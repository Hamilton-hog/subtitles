00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
This massive Flutter course will take you from being an absolute beginner to being able to

00:04.320 --> 00:09.360
release apps on the Google Play Store and the App Store. Vandad is a very experienced

00:09.360 --> 00:14.560
software developer and an excellent teacher. Hello everyone and welcome to this free Flutter

00:14.560 --> 00:19.360
course. My name is Vandad and I'm a Google Developer Expert for Flutter and Dart.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.800
Let's jump right in. Who is this course for? I designed this course mainly for absolute

00:24.800 --> 00:29.440
beginners, so whoever hasn't even done a written a single line of code before.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.080
I actually, when designing this course, I designed it for two specific personas. One was a graphic

00:34.080 --> 00:38.400
designer who was working mainly with Figma. Actually, it doesn't really matter what graphical

00:38.400 --> 00:44.160
tool you're using, Photoshop or Figma or whatever or Sketch. And the other persona was a project

00:44.160 --> 00:50.160
manager who's mainly working with Jira. So I made the assumption that you pretty much don't know

00:50.160 --> 00:55.200
anything about software development from before. And even if you're a software developer, you could

00:55.200 --> 00:59.280
perhaps jump over the things that you might know. But if you haven't done

00:59.280 --> 01:03.280
Flutter development from before, I strongly suggest that you actually follow the chapters

01:03.280 --> 01:08.960
chronologically, which is the way I've designed this course basically. So as I mentioned,

01:10.080 --> 01:15.120
when I designed this course, I wanted everybody to just follow the chapters one at a time and one

01:15.120 --> 01:20.560
after each other chronologically. So I highly recommend that you don't jump over chapters just

01:20.560 --> 01:25.600
because there's so much information provided in each chapter. And I will be referring back to

01:25.600 --> 01:29.920
information that I provided in previous chapters in each chapter. So I think it's very good if you

01:29.920 --> 01:35.120
can just follow the course the way I designed it to be consumed, which is chronologically.

01:36.480 --> 01:42.320
And what you learn in this course is not only the basics, but you'll also go from a complete

01:42.320 --> 01:48.240
beginner to being able to release your applications in Apple's App Store and Google's

01:48.240 --> 01:53.680
Play Store. And we're going to be using a blend of different tools and software. We're going to be

01:53.680 --> 01:58.560
using Visual Studio Code. We're using Firebase for the backend, which I'll teach you all about.

01:59.280 --> 02:05.120
We're using even Figma as a graphic designer to create our icons and screenshots and even our

02:05.520 --> 02:12.480
loading screens. So there's lots to be learned. And I'll take you through those steps. And I don't

02:12.480 --> 02:17.440
make any assumptions about what you may know from before. So I'll explain everything along the way.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.360
So you'll go from absolute beginner to being able to actually release your two applications,

02:23.360 --> 02:29.520
which is the same code base in Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. If you're attending this

02:29.520 --> 02:35.600
course, please do follow me on social media. And I'd really appreciate it. I'm Van.np on Twitter.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.160
And also you can find me by my full name on LinkedIn. That'd be much appreciated.

02:40.160 --> 02:46.720
This course, of course, for free. But for those who want to and are able to support me,

02:47.360 --> 02:55.280
then you can do that by buying me a cup of coffee on buymeacoffee.com. So without further ado,

02:55.280 --> 03:03.520
let's just jump right into it. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first chapter of our Flutter

03:03.520 --> 03:10.880
course. There are so many different topics that I could choose for the first chapter.

03:12.240 --> 03:18.720
And they're all very important. However, after going through the material that I've been

03:18.720 --> 03:24.880
preparing for you for this course, I realized that one of the absolute basic points that we

03:24.880 --> 03:32.960
have to go through is the developer accounts for Apple and Google. Now, if you're not familiar

03:32.960 --> 03:38.480
with the term of developer account, there are basically what a developer account allows you to

03:38.480 --> 03:48.320
do is to release your applications on Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. As I mentioned

03:48.400 --> 03:56.160
in the introduction, you may choose to follow along this course without actually releasing the

03:56.160 --> 04:05.200
application to the App Store and the Play Store. But even if you do decide to not release the

04:05.200 --> 04:13.440
applications on the aforementioned stores, you will still, for the optimal experience of development

04:13.440 --> 04:22.080
for iOS and Android, you will most definitely need a developer account. And the reason behind that

04:22.080 --> 04:31.920
is, I mean, it is quite deep to try to explain the actual reason behind it. But from my perspective,

04:31.920 --> 04:36.480
one of the most important reasons you may want to have a developer account is to create the so-called

04:37.200 --> 04:46.080
app IDs. So every application on iOS and every application on Android has an identifier,

04:46.080 --> 04:51.680
which is usually something called a reverse domain identifier. And it's kind of like,

04:52.800 --> 05:01.600
I still find it strange the way it is, but somewhere, somehow it was decided that every

05:02.240 --> 05:07.040
application needs to have an identifier and every identifier is kind of like associated with a

05:07.040 --> 05:10.800
domain name. And a domain name is kind of like a website. For instance, if you have

05:12.240 --> 05:20.640
yourname.com as your website, then you would say that, okay, I'm going to create an application

05:20.640 --> 05:27.600
for iOS and Android in Flutter, and I'm going to call it foobar. Then it was somehow decided

05:27.600 --> 05:34.240
that your application's identifier would then in that case be, if you reverse it,

05:34.880 --> 05:44.800
then it would literally be your domain in reverse, which would be com.yourname.yourapplicationsname.

05:46.320 --> 05:53.680
I don't really know. I mean, if somebody knows the reason behind it, I would be glad to hear that.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.520
And I'm sure that there's resources out there explaining why that is the case, but it kind of

05:57.520 --> 06:07.680
feels like it's become the norm and we just have to roll with it. So the reason I explained the

06:07.680 --> 06:15.840
app identifier is that when you set up your backend later, when we set up the backend later

06:15.840 --> 06:22.320
together, in that the client that we write in Flutter is going to talk with our backend

06:22.880 --> 06:28.880
store the notes, retrieve the notes, create a user, sign in with a user, et cetera, et cetera,

06:30.880 --> 06:38.960
that backend setup also will require you to have your app identifier. And

06:41.280 --> 06:47.440
even though you don't necessarily need to have a developer account to get an app identifier,

06:47.440 --> 06:52.560
because an app identifier is just something that you decide, okay, here's my app identifier.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.440
I think my website is called this, blah, blah. And even though you actually need a website,

06:57.440 --> 07:01.360
that's the thing, but an app identifier is usually associated with a website. So don't

07:01.360 --> 07:05.840
worry about it. You don't have to have a website in order to follow along with these steps that I'm

07:05.840 --> 07:12.720
going to name here, but it is still good practice to create your developer account in order to

07:12.720 --> 07:22.480
officially register your app identifiers. And another reason that you will need a

07:22.480 --> 07:32.320
developer account for Apple and Google is that you will, for Apple, if you want to be able to

07:33.600 --> 07:39.760
deploy your application onto a telephone and not use a simulator,

07:40.720 --> 07:47.120
then you will need to register a developer account and use some resources that Apple provides you

07:47.120 --> 07:53.760
in forms of certificates and keys and profiles in order to deploy your application to a telephone

07:53.760 --> 08:01.200
or an iPad, for instance. In Android, the world is a little bit different in that you don't have

08:01.200 --> 08:09.360
to do the same process, but in order to then submit your application to Google for review,

08:10.160 --> 08:14.080
later, so that it can be available for everybody who has an Android telephone

08:15.360 --> 08:20.560
or a tablet, you will still need a developer account. So it goes without saying that it is

08:20.560 --> 08:32.480
a very important step that even if you decide not to deploy your application later to App Store and

08:32.480 --> 08:39.200
Play Store, it's still a very fundamental step. So I suggest that you actually go through these

08:39.200 --> 08:44.640
steps that I'm going to provide you in the first chapter. And that's why I actually decided to have

08:44.640 --> 08:52.640
this as chapter one. Sorry, I have to just edit my notes a little bit. If you haven't watched the

08:52.640 --> 08:56.720
introduction to this course, and you're just jumping here, I suggest that you go to the

08:56.720 --> 09:01.200
introduction and watch it. I know it was about 34 minutes. It was quite a long introduction,

09:01.200 --> 09:07.360
but there were so many important points that I feel everybody needs to know before you get

09:07.440 --> 09:12.240
started with the course. So please watch those. If you see me moving my head around, then you know

09:12.240 --> 09:19.520
the reason. And I explain a lot of things that are like the fundamentals of this course and the

09:19.520 --> 09:25.760
reasoning behind all those decisions, which I believe are so important that I still suggest

09:25.760 --> 09:33.200
everybody watched an introduction before they actually start with the course. So we've now

09:33.200 --> 09:42.000
talked about the basics. And if you go to why we need a developer account, I believe I've already

09:42.000 --> 09:50.800
covered this in that the developer account is the utility is an account that you register for Apple

09:50.800 --> 09:57.280
and Google that gives you extra resources as a developer in order to be able to deploy your

09:57.760 --> 10:01.760
test and deploy your applications to the respective app stores.

10:04.560 --> 10:14.720
Now, if we talk about developer accounts, there are two main types of developer accounts. One is

10:14.720 --> 10:24.640
an individual account, and the other one is a company account. And for me, the biggest

10:24.640 --> 10:31.760
difference between these two different accounts is the liability. And by liability, I mean, if you

10:33.840 --> 10:42.400
register an individual account, then you as an individual are liable for that application. And

10:42.400 --> 10:46.720
as users download your application and interact with it, if they have any problems and if, for

10:46.720 --> 10:55.840
instance, there's any judiciary problems, like if someone for some reason believes that you're

10:55.840 --> 11:00.320
storing their data in the wrong way or that you're storing their personal information without

11:00.320 --> 11:06.400
exposing that and telling the users about that, then they can personally hold you liable for,

11:08.560 --> 11:15.040
for instance, breach of information or GDPR infringements or whatever it is. So

11:16.800 --> 11:24.080
just know that you can register yourself as an individual for both Apple's App Store and Google's

11:24.080 --> 11:30.640
Play Store, but you need to also be aware that should you wish to do that, then you're personally

11:30.640 --> 11:37.680
liable for any problems that may be occurring in the future. So that's the personal account

11:38.480 --> 11:45.680
or an individual account. And as a company account, then you kind of like, based on what

11:45.680 --> 11:56.960
type of company you've created, you may or may not be personally liable for any damages that may

11:56.960 --> 12:01.360
be caused to your users and if they bring it up to you. Now, I know this is all sounding a lot

12:01.360 --> 12:09.040
serious. In reality, what we are trying to do is not that big a deal, but we are still trying to

12:09.040 --> 12:19.280
store. I mean, the goal of this course is to go through an application and create an application

12:19.280 --> 12:27.360
that can store users' notes. Notes can be quite personal and you're storing those notes then

12:28.320 --> 12:34.240
on a backend that you have full access to. So you're kind of like storing user-created data.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.600
So it is very important that you actually treat that data correctly. Make sure that nobody

12:40.240 --> 12:49.840
except those who are authorized can access that data. So from a responsibility point of view,

12:49.840 --> 12:57.200
it is actually a little bit different what kind of company account you want to create, if that's

12:57.200 --> 13:03.520
what you want to create now. Because for instance, in Sweden, where I live, you can have a personal

13:03.520 --> 13:09.280
company account in that, sorry, a personal company. So you can register a personal company. It

13:09.280 --> 13:16.880
means that you are personally liable for that company. And you can also create a company that

13:18.400 --> 13:23.760
it has like, it's like an umbrella. Basically, it sits on top and then there are people who are

13:24.400 --> 13:28.480
directors of the company and blah, blah. So you're not personally liable.

13:29.440 --> 13:36.240
And that is the same structure that you can find in many other countries. I believe US, Germany,

13:36.240 --> 13:45.040
Sweden, England, many other countries, you can set up companies that are either sole proprietorship

13:45.040 --> 13:48.960
or something called, English is not my first language, but it's something like that. Or you

13:48.960 --> 13:53.120
can create like a limited company that you have limited liability and you're not personally liable.

13:53.120 --> 13:58.560
So these are the different types of developer accounts that you can set up.

13:59.360 --> 14:06.480
So we can, I mean, that point, I think we all understand now that you can create

14:06.480 --> 14:15.600
individual or a company account. Now, I think, I mean, I personally registered already an account

14:16.240 --> 14:22.240
as an iOS developer and an Android app developer. So,

14:24.400 --> 14:31.280
and since I registered a company account, I can't go through setting up the exact same company again,

14:31.920 --> 14:39.520
but at least I can show you some of the steps involved in creating those accounts.

14:40.480 --> 14:48.960
So what we could do is to, now you can't see the screen right now, but I will bring it up here

14:50.560 --> 14:59.040
so that you can also see. Now I'm going to bring my studio here and I'm going to make this screen

14:59.040 --> 15:06.160
a little bit bigger so that you can see my screen better. So let me also make this a little bit

15:06.480 --> 15:12.960
smaller on top so that you can see the content a little bit better.

15:14.800 --> 15:20.560
So you can see here that there are two options available to you. Either you enroll as an individual

15:20.560 --> 15:26.560
or you enroll as an organization. And it is strongly recommended actually.

15:29.440 --> 15:33.200
So you need to make sure that you have two-factor authentication turned on.

15:33.200 --> 15:39.920
And so that's not a problem. All this means basically as an individual, it means that just

15:40.480 --> 15:46.880
you will need an account. You will need to set up an account. However, if you want to set up as an

15:46.880 --> 15:52.160
organization, like if you have a limited company and you want to create an Apple developer account

15:52.160 --> 15:59.040
that is linked to that organization, it's a little bit different because you will need to set up

15:59.040 --> 16:03.520
something called a duns or duns or I don't know how you want to pronounce it D-U-N-S.

16:04.640 --> 16:12.400
Which is kind of like, it's a new thing for me at least, but it is an identifier for your company

16:12.400 --> 16:20.880
that you either have been assigned to already. I think there is a company called DMB.

16:20.880 --> 16:28.720
So if you go to, let me see if I can bring the notes for that.

16:30.720 --> 16:42.320
Let's see. Learn more. If you go to learn more here. Here, DMB is called by Don and Bradstreet.

16:42.320 --> 16:51.440
So there then we have the ability to register a D-U-N-S number.

16:53.360 --> 16:58.800
For me, I was one of the lucky people to have already been assigned a D-U-N-S number for my

16:58.800 --> 17:06.720
company by DMB because you either have, let's see if they write it here.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.440
You see it says DMB may have already assigned your organization a free

17:11.440 --> 17:16.800
D-U-N-S number. Before enrolling, look up your organization to see if you have a D-U-N-S number.

17:16.800 --> 17:24.880
So you can just click on the link and we can go here and you can then select your region. For me,

17:24.880 --> 17:31.040
it would be Sweden. Then I would write my company name, some address information, contact information,

17:31.040 --> 17:37.440
etc. Then you can check whether there is a D-U-N-S number assigned to your company.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.200
So I suggest that you actually do this by going to this website.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.880
So that's for a D-U-N-S number if you already have one, but if you don't have one,

17:50.880 --> 17:58.320
then you will have to create and request a D-U-N-S number from DMB. I would show you the website for

17:58.320 --> 18:05.360
DMB and D-U-N-S number right now, but my browser is set up so that my locale is already provided to

18:05.360 --> 18:09.280
the browser, which is Swedish. Then if I go to the DMB website, you're going to see everything in

18:09.280 --> 18:16.560
Swedish. That doesn't make any sense just to read the information in Swedish. I believe you can go

18:16.560 --> 18:27.040
to DMB's website. So if I search for a DMB, D-U-N-S or D-U-N-S are here. So this is a Swedish

18:28.080 --> 18:33.600
localized website for DMB. Let's see if it can change the language.

18:37.520 --> 18:41.760
Actually, I can see here that they're very, they're actually in Sweden.

18:41.760 --> 18:48.960
And I wonder if we can, here, change country. Let's just say

18:52.880 --> 18:53.600
international.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.200
So if we go here, let's see if we can,

19:03.920 --> 19:10.240
if there's any way to actually request a D-U-N-S number, like if you say D-U-N-S.

19:12.560 --> 19:20.160
And I can't see anything related to that, to be honest with you. So if we go back

19:23.680 --> 19:30.720
here, I can see, I can request the D-U-N-S and here the locale is S-V-S-E. And here,

19:30.720 --> 19:36.400
the locale was E-N-G-B. So what happens if we just go back to this URL that we were on before,

19:36.880 --> 19:44.720
and then I just change the locale? Does that work? Well, unfortunately. But, I mean, here,

19:44.720 --> 19:53.520
D-U-N-S number, get a D-U-N-S number. Okay, that's good. And then, and you can here say,

19:53.520 --> 20:03.040
I'm an Apple developer, press continue. Oh, it sends you back here. That was really bad.

20:03.360 --> 20:14.240
So it says, look up your organization in Apple's website. And when you try to get a D-U-N-S number,

20:15.040 --> 20:26.000
it tells you to go to Apple's website. If we say that, then okay, legal business name, etc., etc.

20:26.720 --> 20:34.160
Then okay, legal business name, etc., etc. Okay, so you will need to go through this process,

20:34.160 --> 20:39.600
which doesn't seem to be completely easy to get a D-U-N-S number. You see, request the D-U-N-S

20:39.600 --> 20:48.240
number. So you probably just want to go to dmb.com, it's like d-u-n-s-number.html. And I can't

20:48.240 --> 20:52.800
explain this complete process, to be honest with you, because first of all, it will be a waste of

20:52.800 --> 21:00.160
time for both of us. Because these are so many moving parts and a third party company that I

21:00.160 --> 21:06.080
have no control over. So if I even try to explain their process, it may change tomorrow. So there's,

21:06.080 --> 21:11.360
it's not a good investment of our time. But everybody else has figured it out. And I'm

21:11.360 --> 21:14.960
pretty sure that if you just go and say, request the D-U-N-S number, you can just

21:15.520 --> 21:21.920
follow the process and then get your D-U-N-S number. But begin by going through,

21:23.120 --> 21:30.560
look up your organization. So you may already have been assigned a free D-U-N-S number. So

21:31.600 --> 21:37.040
do that first, please. But if you have to request the D-U-N-S number, I believe there is a little

21:37.040 --> 21:44.000
bit of a cost to it. And that is about $70. If I'm 70 to $80 at the time of recording this video.

21:44.720 --> 21:55.040
So count with almost about $100. And hopefully not more, hopefully actually a lot less, but around

21:56.720 --> 22:06.160
$70 at least. Does that make sense? I said so many numbers, $70 at least. So try to get your

22:06.160 --> 22:11.920
D-U-N-S number. At least that that's what Apple says you will need. Now, of course, if you want

22:11.920 --> 22:19.840
to register as a company, I can't stress this enough. You will need a website. I remember vividly

22:19.840 --> 22:28.000
when I registered a developer account at Apple and they rejected my request saying that, well,

22:28.640 --> 22:35.680
your website doesn't have any content. And they were right because I just created an empty website,

22:35.680 --> 22:40.800
like a domain. I know I didn't actually create an empty website. I registered a domain.

22:42.240 --> 22:48.480
And there was no website. So when you typed my website's name, it would just not show you anything.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.960
And they came back and said, no, your application is rejected because you don't have a website.

22:54.960 --> 23:01.440
What kind of company are you? So then I had to actually get like a hosting service and I have

23:01.440 --> 23:08.880
some content in there, have like a support. So if you are registering as a website, sorry,

23:08.880 --> 23:14.400
as a company and as an organization, you will need a hosting service. You will need a domain

23:14.400 --> 23:20.480
provider. You will need to ensure that you have a website because they're not the same thing. If

23:20.480 --> 23:26.400
you have a host and you have a domain provider, it still doesn't mean that you have content

23:27.520 --> 23:34.480
on your web page. But what I realized is that if you register your domain and have a hosting

23:34.480 --> 23:39.680
service, make sure that you have a website. Just have some content in there and say, hello,

23:39.680 --> 23:46.240
we are this business, that business. We work with this and this. If you have any questions,

23:46.240 --> 23:50.480
contact this email. And here's our phone number. Here's their address, et cetera. So

23:50.480 --> 23:57.520
you need to ensure that if you have an organization, it is actually an organization. It's not just like,

23:57.520 --> 24:04.080
hi, my name is Fubar. I'm sitting at home. Contact me if you have any questions. Not like that.

24:04.640 --> 24:10.400
So and of course, after you made your decision, you start the enrollment process. So

24:12.400 --> 24:18.560
now learn more, continue enrollment on the web you can do. And then you come here and you will

24:18.560 --> 24:23.920
basically need to provide your information and continue with the process. Now we're not going

24:23.920 --> 24:30.400
to go through this, but the important thing I have to mention here is that as you go through

24:30.400 --> 24:39.040
the enrollment process, as an Apple developer, unfortunately, there is a cost last time, which

24:39.040 --> 24:44.320
is about a few months ago when I registered, or I had to renew my registration. You have to renew

24:44.320 --> 24:53.840
your registration for Apple's developer account. You have to renew it every year. And as I've

24:53.840 --> 25:02.000
mentioned here, the process is not free, unfortunately. It costs, or last time I

25:02.000 --> 25:07.520
registered or renewed my registration, it costs $99. And I believe it's been $99 for a very long

25:07.520 --> 25:12.720
time. So if you're in Sweden, it costs about a thousand crowns. If you're in England, it probably

25:12.720 --> 25:19.760
costs about 80 pounds or something. And in the US it's about, yeah, just count with almost $100. So

25:20.320 --> 25:24.400
I used to be able to provide this like you have to have some sort of a credit card or debit card

25:24.400 --> 25:30.400
to be able to pay for it. So after you've done that, after you register your account as an

25:30.400 --> 25:35.760
organization, you will have direct access then, or an immediate access to your developer account.

25:35.760 --> 25:42.720
And you can start developing applications, et cetera, et cetera. So if you're following along

25:43.520 --> 25:50.240
with this course and you want to deploy your application to the App Store and Play Store,

25:50.240 --> 25:58.640
please do this first. Get your developer account either as an organization or as an individual.

25:59.600 --> 26:04.160
Get that process out of the way because a developer account, especially if you're an

26:04.160 --> 26:10.480
organization, as I mentioned here, is not a super fast process. I mean, when you get the account,

26:10.480 --> 26:16.960
then it's simple. It's fast and you're in there immediately. But the process itself is a long

26:16.960 --> 26:22.640
process. So I remember for me, it took about two weeks because I got one rejection. It took about

26:22.640 --> 26:31.680
one week for them to review the documents again. So it's not a fast process, unfortunately. It's

26:31.680 --> 26:42.960
like very, yeah, it's just a long, long, boring process. So get that out of the way, if you can,

26:42.960 --> 26:59.600
please. So that's for the long and not free part for iOS. And also, one more thing that I need to

26:59.600 --> 27:06.800
mention is that if you're registering and you want to sell applications, which is not the purpose of

27:06.800 --> 27:11.520
this course, but if you want to sell applications, then you will have to provide some banking

27:12.080 --> 27:17.440
and tax information. So they need to ensure that the stuff that you're selling in different

27:17.440 --> 27:22.720
countries, the money that is then being sent to your bank account, will be accounted for when

27:22.720 --> 27:30.240
you're paying your taxes. So, and I believe that if you're trying to sell apps on the app store,

27:30.240 --> 27:38.320
then you will have to fill in some forms with the US tax offices. I don't even remember IRS, I think

27:39.840 --> 27:45.280
internal revenue services or something like the IRS. I believe that you have to fill some forms,

27:45.280 --> 27:49.680
like send the forms to them, then they will come back with some sort of identifier to you.

27:49.680 --> 27:54.960
And then you will need to use that identifier on Apple's website in order to basically say

27:54.960 --> 27:59.840
that, yeah, yeah, I know, I'm selling stuff in the US, I'm selling stuff in Japan, I'm selling

27:59.840 --> 28:06.960
stuff in Sweden, Norway, but I'm going to pay taxes for them here in my country. And that's

28:06.960 --> 28:15.360
what the form says here. Here's my name, here's my company. I'm an organization or I'm an individual,

28:15.360 --> 28:23.200
so I have no company. My personal identification number in my country is this, is my address,

28:23.200 --> 28:28.240
my phone number, et cetera. And then you send it to them, to IRS, and then they come back and say,

28:28.240 --> 28:35.920
okay, now we know who you are. And here is your identifier number, like a business identifier

28:35.920 --> 28:40.320
number, BIN or something they call it, I think. I don't remember exactly, but I believe depending

28:40.320 --> 28:43.920
on whether you're a business or an individual, then the number is a little bit different.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.800
So if you're a business, I think it's BIN. And if you're an individual is in, I don't know.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.560
So I don't know what that dialogue was. Some Bluetooth devices wants to connect to my computer.

28:54.560 --> 29:03.040
I don't know what it is. So that's that part. It can be long and it's not free. Okay.

29:05.920 --> 29:13.840
That was a lot of information. That's for iOS. Now, what we can do now is to talk

29:13.840 --> 29:19.680
a little bit about Android as well. And the good thing about the Android process,

29:19.680 --> 29:26.000
like setting up your account for, as a Google developer, is that it's a lot more straightforward

29:26.000 --> 29:32.320
as you would expect from Google. And given that they're even like sending updates to

29:32.320 --> 29:37.360
an Android app to the Google developer console is a lot more straightforward than it is for iOS.

29:37.360 --> 29:42.640
I don't want to scare you, but it is a fact. And you will know that later when we actually

29:42.640 --> 29:48.800
get to the end of this course where we release the apps for iOS and Android, that it is a little

29:48.800 --> 29:58.080
bit more straightforward for Google Play Store. But you still need to sign up for a developer

29:58.080 --> 30:08.080
account. So I'm going to take in my notes that I've talked about that. So what we also need to know

30:08.080 --> 30:14.000
is that there is a URL that we can go to. I'm going to copy that and paste it over here. So

30:14.000 --> 30:22.400
you see which one I'm talking about. Over here. Then you can see that you can set up a developer

30:22.400 --> 30:26.080
account. And once you've logged in, so I'm assuming that you're logged in, then you go to

30:26.080 --> 30:34.560
play.google.com slash console slash user or you zero sign up where URL, it may change. So let's

30:34.560 --> 30:40.480
just, what you can do is just a Google, Google Play Console developer account or a Google

30:40.480 --> 30:46.000
developer account. Then you will end up in a URL that looks kind of like this. So don't count

30:46.000 --> 30:50.400
with this URL that I mentioned here because it may change. That's what I'm saying. And

30:51.760 --> 30:55.920
you can, as it is for iOS development, you can either set it up personally as an individual or

30:55.920 --> 31:01.040
you can set up as an organization. Now I happen to have set it up for myself as an organization

31:01.040 --> 31:06.080
because I do have a company here in Sweden. So it is a lot easier for me to tie all my business

31:06.080 --> 31:11.200
relations with Apple and Google into one entity, which is my developer account for,

31:13.600 --> 31:20.880
sorry, which is my company. So it wouldn't make so much sense for me to explain this either to go

31:20.880 --> 31:25.120
through all the details, but if you want to set it up for yourself as an individual, just press on

31:25.120 --> 31:28.480
get started. Or if you want to set up as an organization, just press get started there.

31:28.480 --> 31:33.920
As you can see, you can provide information about your organization. And you can see here as well,

31:34.480 --> 31:39.920
as soon as you say I'm an organization, then they say, okay, what's the website? So you can see if

31:39.920 --> 31:43.520
you say, I don't have a website, we recommend adding a website that represents your organization.

31:43.520 --> 31:48.320
Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, if you're a company, where's your website? Every company

31:48.320 --> 31:53.520
should have a website unless you're like a pizza restaurant or something. Even a pizza restaurant

31:53.520 --> 31:57.280
probably needs a website, but we have a pizza restaurant here in our town that doesn't have

31:57.280 --> 32:05.280
a website. So they're on Facebook. And you probably don't want to say that your company's

32:05.280 --> 32:13.680
website is on Facebook. So yeah, where were we? Here. And if you say you're an individual,

32:13.680 --> 32:19.840
then you come here and they ask for some other stuff, but still interesting because

32:20.720 --> 32:27.120
it says enter the URL of your website or social media profile. So here you kind of have to need

32:28.080 --> 32:32.400
to enter that as well. So maybe you can get away with a Facebook URL. I laughed about it, but

32:33.280 --> 32:37.120
maybe you can get away with it. I don't know. But I don't recommend that, to be honest with you,

32:37.120 --> 32:43.040
because as you will see later in the course, when we actually submit our apps to App Store and Play

32:43.040 --> 32:51.120
Store, there are a few key data points that you have to provide to both stores. One is a privacy

32:51.200 --> 33:03.840
policy URL, and the other one is a support URL. And there are also two other emails you have to

33:03.840 --> 33:14.160
provide. The first one is the support email and the other one is a contact email. And if you're

33:14.160 --> 33:18.560
setting up a business account, then I really suggest that you actually set up a website,

33:18.560 --> 33:23.040
because if you set up a website and you have a domain, you have an email provider,

33:23.040 --> 33:32.160
then your email will kind of be like foobar at mybusiness.com. It's a lot more professional

33:32.160 --> 33:39.280
to set up an email that is connected to your email or to your domain than it is to say

33:40.000 --> 33:47.920
mrjohnson at gmail.com. I wouldn't trust a business that has a gmail.com account.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.960
I kind of want to know that, yeah, here's a serious business, that they have their own website,

33:52.960 --> 34:01.040
and blah, blah, blah. But on the contrary, setting up a website, setting up some emails

34:01.040 --> 34:06.960
doesn't necessarily mean you're serious either. But it makes it more dedicated, if you know what

34:06.960 --> 34:17.680
I mean. So yeah, that's the process for setting up an account also as an Android developer.

34:19.520 --> 34:26.640
I think that's about it. That's all I wanted to mention in this first chapter of our course.

34:28.320 --> 34:34.000
I highly recommend that you get your developer accounts for Apple and for

34:37.120 --> 34:43.520
Google. What you'll also need to know is that, I mean, I've talked a lot about now,

34:44.000 --> 34:53.920
Apple account and a Google developer account, but if you're developing your application

34:56.160 --> 35:00.240
on a Windows machine, for instance, if you're trying to learn how to develop Flutter

35:00.240 --> 35:04.560
applications and you don't care about releasing your application at all, you don't have to do

35:04.560 --> 35:12.400
any of this. Just follow along with the course as usual, no problem. But if you want to actually

35:12.400 --> 35:17.840
release your application for iOS, then you most definitely need to also have a Mac because you

35:17.840 --> 35:23.840
can't build your application otherwise. There are some tricks you can do. You can build your

35:23.840 --> 35:29.040
Flutter application and later on, like a friend's Macintosh if they have one, or you can send it to

35:29.040 --> 35:33.600
a service that's in the cloud and they build the app for you and then they will send it back to

35:33.600 --> 35:39.280
you and then you can submit it. Or maybe they even have to submit it. It's a bit hairy, to be

35:39.280 --> 35:45.840
honest with you, but it's a complicated topic. It is a little bit difficult to explain.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.120
For instance, if you're on a Windows machine, you can't even have Xcode. Xcode is the tool

35:53.680 --> 36:01.840
and the entire chain of tool sets that gets installed on a Macintosh in order to build

36:02.880 --> 36:08.560
an application for iOS platform. Now, why am I talking about this? The reasoning behind that

36:08.560 --> 36:15.520
is that if you're developing a Flutter application, then Flutter can be deployed

36:15.520 --> 36:24.080
on a Windows machine, Macintosh, or collectively called as desktop, web, Android, iOS, five

36:24.080 --> 36:32.480
platforms at the moment. If you're trying to release your application and build it for iOS,

36:32.480 --> 36:38.800
for instance, and test on an iPhone or an iPad, you can't do that on a Windows machine,

36:38.800 --> 36:45.520
unfortunately. There's nothing wrong with a Windows machine. It's just Apple's fault for

36:45.520 --> 36:51.520
locking down their build systems and alter tools to Macintosh. They haven't made the

36:52.720 --> 36:57.840
conscious decision or yeah, they haven't made the decision to

36:58.640 --> 37:06.240
bring their tool system and tooling to Windows, unfortunately, or Linux. Swift,

37:06.240 --> 37:12.880
which is the language to write native applications for iOS, can be run, I believe, on Linux.

37:13.920 --> 37:19.680
Windows might be, but its main platform is still Mac.

37:20.640 --> 37:25.920
I know that this is a lot of information also to learn, but if there is anything I want to

37:26.720 --> 37:33.600
close this chapter, the first chapter of this course with is, you can learn Flutter and follow

37:33.600 --> 37:38.720
along with the steps I'm going to provide in this course without having to register any accounts

37:38.720 --> 37:48.000
yet. So that's point one. Point two is that you will need a Macintosh if you want to use it for

37:48.640 --> 37:55.520
if you want to comfortably build and release your Flutter app for iOS.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.600
If you want to release your application on Google Play Store, which is point three,

38:03.600 --> 38:09.360
if you want to do that, you will need to register a developer account on Google Play Console,

38:09.920 --> 38:16.320
as I've shown you here. I believe that's all. That's all you need to know. So

38:17.280 --> 38:20.240
some of you may already have all these accounts and don't have to worry about it,

38:21.280 --> 38:27.600
but some may not know all this. If you're coming from a design background, if all you do is work

38:27.600 --> 38:32.000
with Figma, et cetera, this is some of the important information that you'll need to know

38:32.000 --> 38:37.440
about because I don't want you to get frustrated during the process, so I just want you to have

38:37.440 --> 38:43.520
some information so that you can get started at least without too much hassle. All right,

38:43.520 --> 38:49.680
that's it, I think, for this chapter. I can take in my notes that I've explained everything

38:49.680 --> 38:56.320
I wanted to explain. It did take about 35 minutes. It's not unexpected, to be honest.

38:56.320 --> 39:01.280
It's a lot of information, and I kind of want to take my time with it. It's important that you

39:01.840 --> 39:09.200
and for me as well to understand all this. So great. I think that's it for this video.

39:09.920 --> 39:16.640
So I'll see you in the next chapter. Hi, everyone, and welcome to the second chapter of our course.

39:16.640 --> 39:21.440
Now, if you haven't watched the introduction to this course, I really suggest that you do that

39:21.440 --> 39:25.120
before continuing with the course because there are so many points that I'll explain in that

39:25.760 --> 39:30.320
introduction that I believe are so important to understand before continuing with the course. So

39:32.000 --> 39:36.400
in this chapter, what we're going to do is we're going to take care of some setup steps that are

39:36.400 --> 39:43.520
required for pretty much the rest of this course and all the other chapters that follow

39:43.520 --> 39:49.200
along after this one, chapter three, four, and et cetera. So we're going to talk about Flutter,

39:49.200 --> 39:56.560
Dart, Dart Pad, how to install Flutter, whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

39:56.560 --> 40:04.560
And we're also going to talk about Xcode, Android Studio, and we're going to talk about a few

40:04.560 --> 40:11.600
very useful extensions to our code editor. So if you're coming from a background where you

40:11.600 --> 40:17.120
haven't worked with any kind of programming language before, I'm going to take this chapter

40:17.120 --> 40:22.320
quite easy. So if you're an advanced programmer already, you may want to skip this and you already

40:22.320 --> 40:30.720
have Flutter installed, everything, you can skip this chapter without a problem. So let's start by

40:30.720 --> 40:36.960
talking about what Flutter is. Well, traditionally developers and programmers

40:36.960 --> 40:42.960
or software engineers, however you want to call them, they've been creating and writing code with

40:42.960 --> 40:49.120
their fingers in different languages, and then they're targeting different platforms. It's

40:49.120 --> 40:54.640
very important to understand what a language, programming language is versus a platform.

40:55.600 --> 41:06.880
Think of a platform as the end station where a software ends up being run on. So let's say

41:06.880 --> 41:14.720
Windows is a platform, Mac is a platform, Linux is a platform, and iOS that runs on all iPhones

41:14.720 --> 41:22.800
is a platform, Android is a platform, et cetera. Now, you would have programming languages that

41:23.760 --> 41:29.200
you as a software developer would use in order to target those platforms, to write software for

41:29.200 --> 41:34.640
those platforms. So you use a programming language in order to write a piece of code

41:34.640 --> 41:41.520
and be able to run that code on that target platform. So the programming language example

41:41.520 --> 41:52.160
is JavaScript, Python, Swift, Rust. What else is popular right now? Java, Kotlin, all these.

41:52.800 --> 41:59.120
These are programming languages. So you as a software developer who's trying to learn

41:59.120 --> 42:05.840
Flutter would use then Dart as your programming language, as I will soon explain. So

42:08.880 --> 42:12.080
that has been the tradition that a person sits in front of a computer and says,

42:12.080 --> 42:16.080
okay, I want to write a program for Windows. Then they go and write some code maybe with

42:16.080 --> 42:23.440
Csharp.net, or maybe they will just use some other technology. I don't know what's out there

42:23.440 --> 42:30.640
right now for Windows. Maybe they would use VB.net, and then they would be done and they

42:30.640 --> 42:35.840
would release the software for Windows and be like, okay, I'm done. Now, then someone comes

42:35.840 --> 42:41.920
into the project and says, oh, we need the same software for Macintosh, or we need the same software

42:41.920 --> 42:53.200
for some other, for instance, platform. Then you would have to go and write the same software,

42:54.480 --> 43:01.040
exact same code, pretty much, for the other platform. So this process would be very repetitive

43:01.040 --> 43:06.160
in that you would have to write the same software over and over again. So things such as Flutter

43:06.160 --> 43:11.200
came in in order to remedy that. So saying that a software engineer sits at home or sits in the

43:11.200 --> 43:16.000
office, works with a group of other people and a designer maybe, or a few designers, UXer as a

43:16.000 --> 43:24.160
product owner, et cetera. They would write the same code, which will then be run on different

43:24.160 --> 43:32.640
platforms. So as a software developer, you wouldn't have to maintain different, very similar pieces of

43:32.640 --> 43:40.960
code that only can be run on one specific platform. So Flutter in its ground basically is a UI

43:40.960 --> 43:49.600
framework for writing beautiful applications that run on multiple platforms at the same time.

43:50.320 --> 43:58.000
Developed by Google, has been in production for a very long time. It's tried and tested. It's

43:58.000 --> 44:04.960
open source. And if you don't come from a software engineering background, open source basically

44:04.960 --> 44:15.760
means that the code that is written for Flutter, basically the code that makes up Flutter, is open

44:15.760 --> 44:22.720
to the public for finding bugs and also for contributing to it or maybe just learning from

44:22.720 --> 44:27.600
it. So if you're, for instance, coming from a background of as a designer, it's kind of like

44:27.600 --> 44:34.800
you have your Figma file open to the entire world or your Adobe XD source open to the entire world

44:35.120 --> 44:40.560
for them to watch what you're doing as you're designing and also for them to be able to fix

44:40.560 --> 44:49.440
stuff in your design if they see it not working as it should. So that's open source. So Flutter is

44:49.440 --> 44:56.880
open source UI framework developed by Google. What a framework means, I mean, if you're not coming

44:56.880 --> 45:02.720
from a software engineering background, a framework is kind of like a set of tools provided to you

45:02.720 --> 45:07.680
as a software developer. So you can use these tools, take a bit of this one, take a bit of that

45:07.680 --> 45:16.160
one in order to produce an output. So Flutter in itself is a software, but it's more precisely

45:16.800 --> 45:25.440
referred to as a framework because it's a collection of tools. So if you hear framework,

45:25.440 --> 45:29.280
just know, oh, there's a collection of things I can use to produce some output. Now,

45:30.240 --> 45:39.520
that's what Flutter is. But what powers Flutter is a programming language called Dart. And

45:40.400 --> 45:46.560
Dart has been in the making for more than eight years is a language that at the moment being

45:46.560 --> 45:53.440
maintained by Google and also is open source. So anybody can contribute to it, anybody can learn

45:53.440 --> 45:59.120
from it and find exploits or maybe problems with it and it will get patched by the public or by

45:59.120 --> 46:06.960
Google themselves. So Dart is the language, the programming language that powers Flutter, you could

46:06.960 --> 46:18.800
say. So now you know what Flutter is and now you know what Dart is. And I think in the next step

46:18.800 --> 46:27.680
now what we can do is talk about a great piece of web software called Dart Pad. Now,

46:29.120 --> 46:37.200
Dart Pad, as I said, is a web software or you could just call it a website that allows you to

46:37.200 --> 46:47.520
run or write your Dart code, maybe pure Dart code or code for Flutter and run it directly in your

46:47.520 --> 46:53.760
browser without you even having to install anything. So just open your browser and as you

46:53.760 --> 46:59.200
will see soon we go to Dart Pad and you will see how it looks like. So let me just show you a little

46:59.200 --> 47:05.200
demonstration here. So here I have Dart Pad open and I can actually increase the size so you can

47:05.200 --> 47:10.560
see a little bit better. I may have to rearrange some components here on the screen so you can see

47:10.560 --> 47:18.560
the screen better. So I went to dartpad.dartlang.org and you can see here that there is a program

47:18.560 --> 47:27.200
written on the left-hand side and I can actually, yeah, let this what is Dart, Dart Pad allows you,

47:27.200 --> 47:32.480
blah, blah, text to be there so you can have context of what I'm talking about. And you can see

47:32.480 --> 47:38.080
that the program is sitting there and you are allowed then to either change the program the

47:38.080 --> 47:45.120
way it is or click anywhere here to see documentation down here or press the run button.

47:45.120 --> 47:50.560
So I'm just going to press the run button and you can see that the text hello got printed to the

47:50.560 --> 47:56.640
screen five times plus the number of times it was actually printed. It's also printed to the screen.

47:56.640 --> 48:04.720
So hello one, two, three, four, five. So what you see on this side is the source code if you

48:04.720 --> 48:09.360
remember from open source. So this is the source code written in the programming language called

48:09.360 --> 48:18.400
Dart. And this is the output of that program. So Dart Pad allows you to write text here and just

48:18.400 --> 48:27.120
execute it and see the results immediately. So that's what Dart is. I mean, sorry, Dart Pad is.

48:27.120 --> 48:33.760
And we're going to talk about Dart and Dart Pad more in the course. But right now what we should

48:33.760 --> 48:44.160
do is to start by installing Flutter. Because, I mean, you could say, okay, but Flutter is just the

48:46.640 --> 48:54.160
UI framework. How about Dart? Well, the way Flutter is packaged by default is that it includes the

48:54.160 --> 48:59.840
Dart programming language and its runtime. So the tool is required to run any Dart code.

49:00.800 --> 49:06.400
It packages all of that in just one big chunk for you. So you don't have to go and install

49:06.400 --> 49:11.600
different components like install Dart separately in Flutter. So let's just then improvise. And I'm

49:11.600 --> 49:20.640
going to say in here, let's say install Flutter. Okay? Then you go to this beautiful website called

49:20.720 --> 49:25.200
Flutter.dev. I'm going to increase the size here so you see.

49:27.600 --> 49:36.000
So we go there now. And you will see this beautiful website here. And what we're going to do is just

49:36.000 --> 49:42.800
to press on get started. And remember, we pressed on get started. But this website looks like this

49:42.800 --> 49:47.840
right now. Maybe in a few months or maybe in a few years, it will change. So you'll just have

49:47.840 --> 49:53.200
to find out a way to get to the installation part. Right now it's called get started. And I

49:53.200 --> 49:59.840
can see it's located as docs.flutter.dev get started install. Then pick your platform here.

49:59.840 --> 50:04.320
I'm on a Macintosh, but if you're on a Windows, just click on Windows and then you get instructions

50:04.320 --> 50:12.080
on how to install Flutter. And then, or if you're on Linux, you can also do the same. Just get

50:12.080 --> 50:20.560
instructions for your platform. Now I'm on a Mac and I'm going to click on Mac. And then I'm going

50:20.560 --> 50:25.120
to look at this information here. I'm going to increase the size so it's a little bit easier to

50:25.120 --> 50:30.720
read. And it says, okay, download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable

50:30.720 --> 50:39.440
release of the Flutter SDK. SDK means software development kit, I believe. So it's just like

50:40.080 --> 50:46.800
series of tools for you to use. It's just fancy words. So then we're going to do that. Let's just

50:46.800 --> 50:54.880
get Flutter Mac. I'm going to download it. And it may take some time because it is actually quite

50:54.880 --> 51:02.320
a chunky bit of software. As you can see, it's almost 1.2 gigabytes. So depending on your

51:02.320 --> 51:06.880
internet connection, it could take anything between a few seconds to a few minutes.

51:07.520 --> 51:14.640
And after you've done that, then you will have to unzip that in some folder.

51:16.080 --> 51:23.040
So what that means is just I can see that my Mac is already decompressing this zip file

51:23.040 --> 51:27.120
for me. So I don't have to do that myself. And it's already decompressed in this

51:27.120 --> 51:32.880
place. So I'm just going to click on it and I'm going to show you its content. So it looks like

51:32.880 --> 51:42.080
this. Okay. Now that you have this, what you need to do is to ensure that all these files are

51:42.080 --> 51:51.360
placed inside a location on your computer, which is protected so that you don't accidentally

51:51.360 --> 51:57.040
delete it. And it's also a good, like, you know exactly where it is. So by that, I mean,

51:57.040 --> 52:01.200
don't put it on your desktop and don't put it in like documents or anything. It's not a

52:01.200 --> 52:09.840
document. It's a software. What I like to do is usually to have a folder on a Macintosh called

52:09.840 --> 52:17.360
Dev. So I will open Terminal here, as you can see. Terminal, if you're not familiar with it,

52:17.360 --> 52:25.760
is an application that you can control pretty much the entire system with it. If you're on a Mac or

52:25.760 --> 52:30.480
if you're on Linux or any Unix based system. And if you're on Windows, you can also do a lot with

52:30.480 --> 52:39.200
your Terminal. So in Windows, that Terminal is called CMD, I believe, as in command, I believe.

52:40.400 --> 52:47.680
On Linux and Mac, it's called Terminal. I'm using a Terminal here called iTerm.

52:49.680 --> 52:53.520
But if you're on Vanilla Mac OS, then you would go and open Terminal

52:54.080 --> 52:56.400
like this, which is just looking like that.

52:56.400 --> 53:01.920
So I'm going to open iTerm right now, which is my Terminal. You can open the Terminal that

53:01.920 --> 53:09.200
you're comfortable with. I'm going to increase the size of this. I like to place

53:10.640 --> 53:14.880
my installations for these pieces of software in my home directory, which is denoted by this

53:14.880 --> 53:23.040
little funny character, slash dev. And if I look at the contents of this, I can see

53:23.520 --> 53:29.680
if I look at the contents of this, I can see I have a folder called Toolink. If I say Toolink

53:30.560 --> 53:33.280
and look at the contents of it, I can see Flutter is right there.

53:34.560 --> 53:42.160
So for me, Flutter installation, this folder that got downloaded for me in my downloads folder,

53:43.040 --> 53:50.080
I would go and copy its contents and place it in this folder. So if I say CD Flutter,

53:51.040 --> 53:58.480
and then you can see that I'm in my user, Dev folder, Toolink, Flutter. So this is where I

53:58.480 --> 54:03.680
choose to put Flutter. Now you can choose to put this downloaded folder anywhere else, as the

54:03.680 --> 54:12.080
documentation tells you, in the desired location, for example. So go ahead and do that. Pick a

54:12.080 --> 54:17.600
location. For me, this location works. For you, it may be, if you're on Windows, it would probably be

54:17.840 --> 54:26.160
C backslash, I don't know, you could say dev backslash Toolink backslash Flutter. This could

54:26.160 --> 54:33.360
be a good location for your Toolink or Flutter. So I'm imagining now that you've done that. You've

54:33.360 --> 54:38.480
gotten a folder, and for me, it's this one, where you've extracted your Flutter installation in.

54:39.120 --> 54:47.120
Now you can see that it says, in this third step, you will need to expose Flutter's binary

54:47.120 --> 54:55.200
files to your system. And what that basically means is that Flutter as an SDK or a toolkit

54:55.200 --> 55:03.600
or a framework, it has a lot of bits and pieces of software in it. And some of these bits are

55:03.600 --> 55:09.200
more important in that sense that they're actually executable in that. Imagine that

55:10.400 --> 55:15.440
on your computer, whether it's a Macintosh, Windows or Linux, you can have different

55:15.440 --> 55:19.440
documents. Some documents can be text. Some documents can be images. Some documents can

55:20.320 --> 55:25.920
be, I don't know what else they can be. Or a Word document, for instance. Okay,

55:25.920 --> 55:32.080
good. I came up with another example. Or they could be programs. A program is something that

55:32.080 --> 55:36.240
you can just double click on and a piece of software gets executed and then it will open.

55:36.240 --> 55:43.040
For instance, an example of the program is a Microsoft Word. Another example of program is

55:43.040 --> 55:50.320
Google Chrome web browser. Another example of program is Safari. So these are programs.

55:50.320 --> 55:55.440
And Flutter comes also with its own built-in programs that do very specific and important

55:55.440 --> 56:05.360
things on your computer related to Flutter, of course. Sorry, I have to see my recording studio.

56:05.360 --> 56:12.560
Nothing you had to do. It was just for me. So these important programs that are inside

56:12.560 --> 56:17.280
the Flutter installation, which you just downloaded, need to be exposed to your entire system

56:17.920 --> 56:24.080
so that you can work with Flutter with ease. And that means if you're, for instance,

56:24.080 --> 56:30.000
from a design background, it will allow you to anywhere in your terminal, just write Figma

56:30.000 --> 56:35.360
and Figma app would open. And that's the same thing with Flutter. In this folder, you see,

56:35.360 --> 56:41.600
we're in the Flutter folder where you downloaded your installation and installed it in this folder.

56:41.600 --> 56:48.160
There is a folder called bin, which means binary. In here, there are so many things that are important

56:48.160 --> 56:53.920
to the entire system to run. You see Flutter and Dart. These two, I said so many, but yeah,

56:53.920 --> 57:01.840
there's pretty much two. So these two binary executables need to be exposed to your system.

57:02.400 --> 57:07.600
And the way to do that on a Macintosh is to change your paths as is documented here.

57:08.560 --> 57:18.080
So the way I like to do that is I go and change my, if I do a vim and look at my zshrc,

57:19.200 --> 57:27.440
I can see my paths and you can see it here. So you see, I've actually put that export command

57:27.440 --> 57:36.080
as it is stated here. I put it here, you see. This may be a bit intimidating, to be honest with you.

57:37.600 --> 57:43.600
Well, all it's doing is that you see this file that I've placed here, I don't know if I can

57:43.600 --> 57:48.080
actually zoom into it. And if you can see, I don't know how that looked in the actual recording,

57:48.720 --> 57:57.440
but this is sort of like a set of instructions to my terminal on this Macintosh to tell it

57:57.440 --> 58:03.120
where different bits and pieces of binary executables are placed, such as Flutter,

58:03.840 --> 58:10.000
Dart, Python, et cetera, et cetera. So when I install a piece of software in this way,

58:10.000 --> 58:13.040
you see, we just downloaded a package and just put it somewhere on our computer.

58:13.920 --> 58:19.680
Macintosh won't know about the stuff that's in it. Of course it won't. So you have to tell it

58:19.680 --> 58:26.320
where those things are. Because otherwise, if you don't do this step, if you don't do the step three,

58:26.320 --> 58:31.840
then every time you want to run Flutter, then you have to specify exactly where that Flutter command

58:31.840 --> 58:37.840
is. So for me, it would be my home folder, dev tooling Flutter bin slash Flutter. But if you do

58:37.840 --> 58:43.760
this, then you can anywhere in your terminal, just write Flutter and your Macintosh or Linux or

58:44.560 --> 58:52.800
Windows computer will know where to find it. So do that. Put these instructions as specified here

58:52.800 --> 59:00.720
in your path. And after doing that, you may need to reload your path using a command on Windows and

59:00.720 --> 59:08.240
Linux called source and VSHRC for me. Depending on which shell you have, you may have to

59:10.000 --> 59:16.080
put that instruction in somewhere else. On Windows, I believe you will have to modify your

59:17.760 --> 59:24.240
environment variables. I remember this from many, many years ago. Let's see if you have to do that.

59:24.400 --> 59:31.280
Update your path, you see. If you wish to run Flutter commands in regular Windows console,

59:31.280 --> 59:36.080
take these steps, blah, blah. From the start search, end and select edit environment variables

59:36.080 --> 59:40.960
for your account. So what you'll just have to do, really, is just to follow these steps. I mean,

59:40.960 --> 59:46.960
I'm going through basically giving you some of the basics of these instructions so you can get

59:46.960 --> 59:51.760
like a head start. But these instructions can also change in the future. So don't rely just on what

59:51.760 --> 59:59.040
I'm telling you, please. Just go to the installation website here as you see docs.flutter.dev. Get

59:59.040 --> 59:59.840
started and install.
