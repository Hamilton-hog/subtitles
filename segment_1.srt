00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
This massive Flutter course will take you from being an absolute beginner to being able to

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,360
release apps on the Google Play Store and the App Store. Vandad is a very experienced

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,560
software developer and an excellent teacher. Hello everyone and welcome to this free Flutter

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,360
course. My name is Vandad and I'm a Google Developer Expert for Flutter and Dart.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
Let's jump right in. Who is this course for? I designed this course mainly for absolute

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,440
beginners, so whoever hasn't even done a written a single line of code before.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,080
I actually, when designing this course, I designed it for two specific personas. One was a graphic

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,400
designer who was working mainly with Figma. Actually, it doesn't really matter what graphical

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,160
tool you're using, Photoshop or Figma or whatever or Sketch. And the other persona was a project

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,160
manager who's mainly working with Jira. So I made the assumption that you pretty much don't know

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,200
anything about software development from before. And even if you're a software developer, you could

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,280
perhaps jump over the things that you might know. But if you haven't done

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Flutter development from before, I strongly suggest that you actually follow the chapters

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,960
chronologically, which is the way I've designed this course basically. So as I mentioned,

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,120
when I designed this course, I wanted everybody to just follow the chapters one at a time and one

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,560
after each other chronologically. So I highly recommend that you don't jump over chapters just

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
because there's so much information provided in each chapter. And I will be referring back to

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,920
information that I provided in previous chapters in each chapter. So I think it's very good if you

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,120
can just follow the course the way I designed it to be consumed, which is chronologically.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,320
And what you learn in this course is not only the basics, but you'll also go from a complete

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,240
beginner to being able to release your applications in Apple's App Store and Google's

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,680
Play Store. And we're going to be using a blend of different tools and software. We're going to be

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
using Visual Studio Code. We're using Firebase for the backend, which I'll teach you all about.

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,120
We're using even Figma as a graphic designer to create our icons and screenshots and even our

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,480
loading screens. So there's lots to be learned. And I'll take you through those steps. And I don't

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,440
make any assumptions about what you may know from before. So I'll explain everything along the way.

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,360
So you'll go from absolute beginner to being able to actually release your two applications,

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,520
which is the same code base in Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. If you're attending this

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,600
course, please do follow me on social media. And I'd really appreciate it. I'm Van.np on Twitter.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,160
And also you can find me by my full name on LinkedIn. That'd be much appreciated.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,720
This course, of course, for free. But for those who want to and are able to support me,

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,280
then you can do that by buying me a cup of coffee on buymeacoffee.com. So without further ado,

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,520
let's just jump right into it. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first chapter of our Flutter

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,880
course. There are so many different topics that I could choose for the first chapter.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,720
And they're all very important. However, after going through the material that I've been

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,880
preparing for you for this course, I realized that one of the absolute basic points that we

37
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,960
have to go through is the developer accounts for Apple and Google. Now, if you're not familiar

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,480
with the term of developer account, there are basically what a developer account allows you to

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:48,320
do is to release your applications on Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. As I mentioned

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,160
in the introduction, you may choose to follow along this course without actually releasing the

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:05,200
application to the App Store and the Play Store. But even if you do decide to not release the

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,440
applications on the aforementioned stores, you will still, for the optimal experience of development

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:22,080
for iOS and Android, you will most definitely need a developer account. And the reason behind that

44
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:31,920
is, I mean, it is quite deep to try to explain the actual reason behind it. But from my perspective,

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,480
one of the most important reasons you may want to have a developer account is to create the so-called

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:46,080
app IDs. So every application on iOS and every application on Android has an identifier,

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,680
which is usually something called a reverse domain identifier. And it's kind of like,

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:01,600
I still find it strange the way it is, but somewhere, somehow it was decided that every

49
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
application needs to have an identifier and every identifier is kind of like associated with a

50
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,800
domain name. And a domain name is kind of like a website. For instance, if you have

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,640
yourname.com as your website, then you would say that, okay, I'm going to create an application

52
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,600
for iOS and Android in Flutter, and I'm going to call it foobar. Then it was somehow decided

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,240
that your application's identifier would then in that case be, if you reverse it,

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:44,800
then it would literally be your domain in reverse, which would be com.yourname.yourapplicationsname.

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,680
I don't really know. I mean, if somebody knows the reason behind it, I would be glad to hear that.

56
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
And I'm sure that there's resources out there explaining why that is the case, but it kind of

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:07,680
feels like it's become the norm and we just have to roll with it. So the reason I explained the

58
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,840
app identifier is that when you set up your backend later, when we set up the backend later

59
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,320
together, in that the client that we write in Flutter is going to talk with our backend

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,880
store the notes, retrieve the notes, create a user, sign in with a user, et cetera, et cetera,

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,960
that backend setup also will require you to have your app identifier. And

62
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,440
even though you don't necessarily need to have a developer account to get an app identifier,

63
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,560
because an app identifier is just something that you decide, okay, here's my app identifier.

64
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,440
I think my website is called this, blah, blah. And even though you actually need a website,

65
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,360
that's the thing, but an app identifier is usually associated with a website. So don't

66
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
worry about it. You don't have to have a website in order to follow along with these steps that I'm

67
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,720
going to name here, but it is still good practice to create your developer account in order to

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:22,480
officially register your app identifiers. And another reason that you will need a

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:32,320
developer account for Apple and Google is that you will, for Apple, if you want to be able to

70
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,760
deploy your application onto a telephone and not use a simulator,

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,120
then you will need to register a developer account and use some resources that Apple provides you

72
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,760
in forms of certificates and keys and profiles in order to deploy your application to a telephone

73
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,200
or an iPad, for instance. In Android, the world is a little bit different in that you don't have

74
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:09,360
to do the same process, but in order to then submit your application to Google for review,

75
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,080
later, so that it can be available for everybody who has an Android telephone

76
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,560
or a tablet, you will still need a developer account. So it goes without saying that it is

77
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:32,480
a very important step that even if you decide not to deploy your application later to App Store and

78
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Play Store, it's still a very fundamental step. So I suggest that you actually go through these

79
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,640
steps that I'm going to provide you in the first chapter. And that's why I actually decided to have

80
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,640
this as chapter one. Sorry, I have to just edit my notes a little bit. If you haven't watched the

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
introduction to this course, and you're just jumping here, I suggest that you go to the

82
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
introduction and watch it. I know it was about 34 minutes. It was quite a long introduction,

83
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,360
but there were so many important points that I feel everybody needs to know before you get

84
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,240
started with the course. So please watch those. If you see me moving my head around, then you know

85
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,520
the reason. And I explain a lot of things that are like the fundamentals of this course and the

86
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,760
reasoning behind all those decisions, which I believe are so important that I still suggest

87
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,200
everybody watched an introduction before they actually start with the course. So we've now

88
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:42,000
talked about the basics. And if you go to why we need a developer account, I believe I've already

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,800
covered this in that the developer account is the utility is an account that you register for Apple

90
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,280
and Google that gives you extra resources as a developer in order to be able to deploy your

91
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
test and deploy your applications to the respective app stores.

92
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:14,720
Now, if we talk about developer accounts, there are two main types of developer accounts. One is

93
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:24,640
an individual account, and the other one is a company account. And for me, the biggest

94
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,760
difference between these two different accounts is the liability. And by liability, I mean, if you

95
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:42,400
register an individual account, then you as an individual are liable for that application. And

96
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,720
as users download your application and interact with it, if they have any problems and if, for

97
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:55,840
instance, there's any judiciary problems, like if someone for some reason believes that you're

98
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,320
storing their data in the wrong way or that you're storing their personal information without

99
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,400
exposing that and telling the users about that, then they can personally hold you liable for,

100
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,040
for instance, breach of information or GDPR infringements or whatever it is. So

101
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,080
just know that you can register yourself as an individual for both Apple's App Store and Google's

102
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,640
Play Store, but you need to also be aware that should you wish to do that, then you're personally

103
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,680
liable for any problems that may be occurring in the future. So that's the personal account

104
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,680
or an individual account. And as a company account, then you kind of like, based on what

105
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:56,960
type of company you've created, you may or may not be personally liable for any damages that may

106
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,360
be caused to your users and if they bring it up to you. Now, I know this is all sounding a lot

107
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,040
serious. In reality, what we are trying to do is not that big a deal, but we are still trying to

108
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:19,280
store. I mean, the goal of this course is to go through an application and create an application

109
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:27,360
that can store users' notes. Notes can be quite personal and you're storing those notes then

110
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,240
on a backend that you have full access to. So you're kind of like storing user-created data.

111
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,600
So it is very important that you actually treat that data correctly. Make sure that nobody

112
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,840
except those who are authorized can access that data. So from a responsibility point of view,

113
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:57,200
it is actually a little bit different what kind of company account you want to create, if that's

114
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,520
what you want to create now. Because for instance, in Sweden, where I live, you can have a personal

115
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,280
company account in that, sorry, a personal company. So you can register a personal company. It

116
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,880
means that you are personally liable for that company. And you can also create a company that

117
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,760
it has like, it's like an umbrella. Basically, it sits on top and then there are people who are

118
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,480
directors of the company and blah, blah. So you're not personally liable.

119
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,240
And that is the same structure that you can find in many other countries. I believe US, Germany,

120
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:45,040
Sweden, England, many other countries, you can set up companies that are either sole proprietorship

121
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,960
or something called, English is not my first language, but it's something like that. Or you

122
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,120
can create like a limited company that you have limited liability and you're not personally liable.

123
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,560
So these are the different types of developer accounts that you can set up.

124
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,480
So we can, I mean, that point, I think we all understand now that you can create

125
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:15,600
individual or a company account. Now, I think, I mean, I personally registered already an account

126
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,240
as an iOS developer and an Android app developer. So,

127
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,280
and since I registered a company account, I can't go through setting up the exact same company again,

128
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,520
but at least I can show you some of the steps involved in creating those accounts.

129
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,960
So what we could do is to, now you can't see the screen right now, but I will bring it up here

130
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:59,040
so that you can also see. Now I'm going to bring my studio here and I'm going to make this screen

131
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,160
a little bit bigger so that you can see my screen better. So let me also make this a little bit

132
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,960
smaller on top so that you can see the content a little bit better.

133
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,560
So you can see here that there are two options available to you. Either you enroll as an individual

134
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
or you enroll as an organization. And it is strongly recommended actually.

135
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,200
So you need to make sure that you have two-factor authentication turned on.

136
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,920
And so that's not a problem. All this means basically as an individual, it means that just

137
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,880
you will need an account. You will need to set up an account. However, if you want to set up as an

138
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,160
organization, like if you have a limited company and you want to create an Apple developer account

139
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,040
that is linked to that organization, it's a little bit different because you will need to set up

140
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,520
something called a duns or duns or I don't know how you want to pronounce it D-U-N-S.

141
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:12,400
Which is kind of like, it's a new thing for me at least, but it is an identifier for your company

142
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,880
that you either have been assigned to already. I think there is a company called DMB.

143
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,720
So if you go to, let me see if I can bring the notes for that.

144
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:42,320
Let's see. Learn more. If you go to learn more here. Here, DMB is called by Don and Bradstreet.

145
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:51,440
So there then we have the ability to register a D-U-N-S number.

146
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,800
For me, I was one of the lucky people to have already been assigned a D-U-N-S number for my

147
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,720
company by DMB because you either have, let's see if they write it here.

148
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,440
You see it says DMB may have already assigned your organization a free

149
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,800
D-U-N-S number. Before enrolling, look up your organization to see if you have a D-U-N-S number.

150
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,880
So you can just click on the link and we can go here and you can then select your region. For me,

151
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,040
it would be Sweden. Then I would write my company name, some address information, contact information,

152
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,440
etc. Then you can check whether there is a D-U-N-S number assigned to your company.

153
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
So I suggest that you actually do this by going to this website.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
So that's for a D-U-N-S number if you already have one, but if you don't have one,

155
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,320
then you will have to create and request a D-U-N-S number from DMB. I would show you the website for

156
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,360
DMB and D-U-N-S number right now, but my browser is set up so that my locale is already provided to

157
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,280
the browser, which is Swedish. Then if I go to the DMB website, you're going to see everything in

158
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,560
Swedish. That doesn't make any sense just to read the information in Swedish. I believe you can go

159
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:27,040
to DMB's website. So if I search for a DMB, D-U-N-S or D-U-N-S are here. So this is a Swedish

160
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,600
localized website for DMB. Let's see if it can change the language.

161
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,760
Actually, I can see here that they're very, they're actually in Sweden.

162
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,960
And I wonder if we can, here, change country. Let's just say

163
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,600
international.

164
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,200
So if we go here, let's see if we can,

165
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,240
if there's any way to actually request a D-U-N-S number, like if you say D-U-N-S.

166
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,160
And I can't see anything related to that, to be honest with you. So if we go back

167
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,720
here, I can see, I can request the D-U-N-S and here the locale is S-V-S-E. And here,

168
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,400
the locale was E-N-G-B. So what happens if we just go back to this URL that we were on before,

169
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,720
and then I just change the locale? Does that work? Well, unfortunately. But, I mean, here,

170
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:53,520
D-U-N-S number, get a D-U-N-S number. Okay, that's good. And then, and you can here say,

171
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm an Apple developer, press continue. Oh, it sends you back here. That was really bad.

172
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:14,240
So it says, look up your organization in Apple's website. And when you try to get a D-U-N-S number,

173
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:26,000
it tells you to go to Apple's website. If we say that, then okay, legal business name, etc., etc.

174
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,160
Then okay, legal business name, etc., etc. Okay, so you will need to go through this process,

175
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,600
which doesn't seem to be completely easy to get a D-U-N-S number. You see, request the D-U-N-S

176
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:48,240
number. So you probably just want to go to dmb.com, it's like d-u-n-s-number.html. And I can't

177
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,800
explain this complete process, to be honest with you, because first of all, it will be a waste of

178
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,160
time for both of us. Because these are so many moving parts and a third party company that I

179
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,080
have no control over. So if I even try to explain their process, it may change tomorrow. So there's,

180
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
it's not a good investment of our time. But everybody else has figured it out. And I'm

181
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
pretty sure that if you just go and say, request the D-U-N-S number, you can just

182
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,920
follow the process and then get your D-U-N-S number. But begin by going through,

183
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,560
look up your organization. So you may already have been assigned a free D-U-N-S number. So

184
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,040
do that first, please. But if you have to request the D-U-N-S number, I believe there is a little

185
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:44,000
bit of a cost to it. And that is about $70. If I'm 70 to $80 at the time of recording this video.

186
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:55,040
So count with almost about $100. And hopefully not more, hopefully actually a lot less, but around

187
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:06,160
$70 at least. Does that make sense? I said so many numbers, $70 at least. So try to get your

188
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,920
D-U-N-S number. At least that that's what Apple says you will need. Now, of course, if you want

189
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:19,840
to register as a company, I can't stress this enough. You will need a website. I remember vividly

190
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,000
when I registered a developer account at Apple and they rejected my request saying that, well,

191
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,680
your website doesn't have any content. And they were right because I just created an empty website,

192
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,800
like a domain. I know I didn't actually create an empty website. I registered a domain.

193
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,480
And there was no website. So when you typed my website's name, it would just not show you anything.

194
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,960
And they came back and said, no, your application is rejected because you don't have a website.

195
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,440
What kind of company are you? So then I had to actually get like a hosting service and I have

196
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,880
some content in there, have like a support. So if you are registering as a website, sorry,

197
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
as a company and as an organization, you will need a hosting service. You will need a domain

198
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,480
provider. You will need to ensure that you have a website because they're not the same thing. If

199
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,400
you have a host and you have a domain provider, it still doesn't mean that you have content

200
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,480
on your web page. But what I realized is that if you register your domain and have a hosting

201
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,680
service, make sure that you have a website. Just have some content in there and say, hello,

202
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,240
we are this business, that business. We work with this and this. If you have any questions,

203
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,480
contact this email. And here's our phone number. Here's their address, et cetera. So

204
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,520
you need to ensure that if you have an organization, it is actually an organization. It's not just like,

205
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,080
hi, my name is Fubar. I'm sitting at home. Contact me if you have any questions. Not like that.

206
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,400
So and of course, after you made your decision, you start the enrollment process. So

207
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,560
now learn more, continue enrollment on the web you can do. And then you come here and you will

208
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,920
basically need to provide your information and continue with the process. Now we're not going

209
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,400
to go through this, but the important thing I have to mention here is that as you go through

210
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:39,040
the enrollment process, as an Apple developer, unfortunately, there is a cost last time, which

211
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,320
is about a few months ago when I registered, or I had to renew my registration. You have to renew

212
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:53,840
your registration for Apple's developer account. You have to renew it every year. And as I've

213
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:02,000
mentioned here, the process is not free, unfortunately. It costs, or last time I

214
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,520
registered or renewed my registration, it costs $99. And I believe it's been $99 for a very long

215
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,720
time. So if you're in Sweden, it costs about a thousand crowns. If you're in England, it probably

216
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,760
costs about 80 pounds or something. And in the US it's about, yeah, just count with almost $100. So

217
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,400
I used to be able to provide this like you have to have some sort of a credit card or debit card

218
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,400
to be able to pay for it. So after you've done that, after you register your account as an

219
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,760
organization, you will have direct access then, or an immediate access to your developer account.

220
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,720
And you can start developing applications, et cetera, et cetera. So if you're following along

221
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,240
with this course and you want to deploy your application to the App Store and Play Store,

222
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:58,640
please do this first. Get your developer account either as an organization or as an individual.

223
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Get that process out of the way because a developer account, especially if you're an

224
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,480
organization, as I mentioned here, is not a super fast process. I mean, when you get the account,

225
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,960
then it's simple. It's fast and you're in there immediately. But the process itself is a long

226
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,640
process. So I remember for me, it took about two weeks because I got one rejection. It took about

227
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:31,680
one week for them to review the documents again. So it's not a fast process, unfortunately. It's

228
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:42,960
like very, yeah, it's just a long, long, boring process. So get that out of the way, if you can,

229
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:59,600
please. So that's for the long and not free part for iOS. And also, one more thing that I need to

230
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,800
mention is that if you're registering and you want to sell applications, which is not the purpose of

231
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,520
this course, but if you want to sell applications, then you will have to provide some banking

232
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,440
and tax information. So they need to ensure that the stuff that you're selling in different

233
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,720
countries, the money that is then being sent to your bank account, will be accounted for when

234
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:30,240
you're paying your taxes. So, and I believe that if you're trying to sell apps on the app store,

235
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:38,320
then you will have to fill in some forms with the US tax offices. I don't even remember IRS, I think

236
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,280
internal revenue services or something like the IRS. I believe that you have to fill some forms,

237
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,680
like send the forms to them, then they will come back with some sort of identifier to you.

238
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,960
And then you will need to use that identifier on Apple's website in order to basically say

239
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,840
that, yeah, yeah, I know, I'm selling stuff in the US, I'm selling stuff in Japan, I'm selling

240
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,960
stuff in Sweden, Norway, but I'm going to pay taxes for them here in my country. And that's

241
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,360
what the form says here. Here's my name, here's my company. I'm an organization or I'm an individual,

242
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:23,200
so I have no company. My personal identification number in my country is this, is my address,

243
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,240
my phone number, et cetera. And then you send it to them, to IRS, and then they come back and say,

244
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,920
okay, now we know who you are. And here is your identifier number, like a business identifier

245
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,320
number, BIN or something they call it, I think. I don't remember exactly, but I believe depending

246
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,920
on whether you're a business or an individual, then the number is a little bit different.

247
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,800
So if you're a business, I think it's BIN. And if you're an individual is in, I don't know.

248
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,560
So I don't know what that dialogue was. Some Bluetooth devices wants to connect to my computer.

249
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:03,040
I don't know what it is. So that's that part. It can be long and it's not free. Okay.

250
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:13,840
That was a lot of information. That's for iOS. Now, what we can do now is to talk

251
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,680
a little bit about Android as well. And the good thing about the Android process,

252
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:26,000
like setting up your account for, as a Google developer, is that it's a lot more straightforward

253
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,320
as you would expect from Google. And given that they're even like sending updates to

254
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,360
an Android app to the Google developer console is a lot more straightforward than it is for iOS.

255
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,640
I don't want to scare you, but it is a fact. And you will know that later when we actually

256
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,800
get to the end of this course where we release the apps for iOS and Android, that it is a little

257
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:58,080
bit more straightforward for Google Play Store. But you still need to sign up for a developer

258
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:08,080
account. So I'm going to take in my notes that I've talked about that. So what we also need to know

259
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,000
is that there is a URL that we can go to. I'm going to copy that and paste it over here. So

260
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,400
you see which one I'm talking about. Over here. Then you can see that you can set up a developer

261
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,080
account. And once you've logged in, so I'm assuming that you're logged in, then you go to

262
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:34,560
play.google.com slash console slash user or you zero sign up where URL, it may change. So let's

263
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,480
just, what you can do is just a Google, Google Play Console developer account or a Google

264
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,000
developer account. Then you will end up in a URL that looks kind of like this. So don't count

265
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,400
with this URL that I mentioned here because it may change. That's what I'm saying. And

266
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,920
you can, as it is for iOS development, you can either set it up personally as an individual or

267
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,040
you can set up as an organization. Now I happen to have set it up for myself as an organization

268
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,080
because I do have a company here in Sweden. So it is a lot easier for me to tie all my business

269
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,200
relations with Apple and Google into one entity, which is my developer account for,

270
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,880
sorry, which is my company. So it wouldn't make so much sense for me to explain this either to go

271
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,120
through all the details, but if you want to set it up for yourself as an individual, just press on

272
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,480
get started. Or if you want to set up as an organization, just press get started there.

273
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,920
As you can see, you can provide information about your organization. And you can see here as well,

274
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,920
as soon as you say I'm an organization, then they say, okay, what's the website? So you can see if

275
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,520
you say, I don't have a website, we recommend adding a website that represents your organization.

276
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,320
Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, if you're a company, where's your website? Every company

277
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,520
should have a website unless you're like a pizza restaurant or something. Even a pizza restaurant

278
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,280
probably needs a website, but we have a pizza restaurant here in our town that doesn't have

279
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:05,280
a website. So they're on Facebook. And you probably don't want to say that your company's

280
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:13,680
website is on Facebook. So yeah, where were we? Here. And if you say you're an individual,

281
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,840
then you come here and they ask for some other stuff, but still interesting because

282
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,120
it says enter the URL of your website or social media profile. So here you kind of have to need

283
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,400
to enter that as well. So maybe you can get away with a Facebook URL. I laughed about it, but

284
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,120
maybe you can get away with it. I don't know. But I don't recommend that, to be honest with you,

285
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,040
because as you will see later in the course, when we actually submit our apps to App Store and Play

286
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:51,120
Store, there are a few key data points that you have to provide to both stores. One is a privacy

287
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:03,840
policy URL, and the other one is a support URL. And there are also two other emails you have to

288
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:14,160
provide. The first one is the support email and the other one is a contact email. And if you're

289
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,560
setting up a business account, then I really suggest that you actually set up a website,

290
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,040
because if you set up a website and you have a domain, you have an email provider,

291
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:32,160
then your email will kind of be like foobar at mybusiness.com. It's a lot more professional

292
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:39,280
to set up an email that is connected to your email or to your domain than it is to say

293
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,920
mrjohnson at gmail.com. I wouldn't trust a business that has a gmail.com account.

294
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,960
I kind of want to know that, yeah, here's a serious business, that they have their own website,

295
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:01,040
and blah, blah, blah. But on the contrary, setting up a website, setting up some emails

296
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,960
doesn't necessarily mean you're serious either. But it makes it more dedicated, if you know what

297
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:17,680
I mean. So yeah, that's the process for setting up an account also as an Android developer.

298
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,640
I think that's about it. That's all I wanted to mention in this first chapter of our course.

299
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,000
I highly recommend that you get your developer accounts for Apple and for

300
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,520
Google. What you'll also need to know is that, I mean, I've talked a lot about now,

301
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,920
Apple account and a Google developer account, but if you're developing your application

302
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,240
on a Windows machine, for instance, if you're trying to learn how to develop Flutter

303
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,560
applications and you don't care about releasing your application at all, you don't have to do

304
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,400
any of this. Just follow along with the course as usual, no problem. But if you want to actually

305
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,840
release your application for iOS, then you most definitely need to also have a Mac because you

306
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,840
can't build your application otherwise. There are some tricks you can do. You can build your

307
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Flutter application and later on, like a friend's Macintosh if they have one, or you can send it to

308
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,600
a service that's in the cloud and they build the app for you and then they will send it back to

309
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,280
you and then you can submit it. Or maybe they even have to submit it. It's a bit hairy, to be

310
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,840
honest with you, but it's a complicated topic. It is a little bit difficult to explain.

311
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,120
For instance, if you're on a Windows machine, you can't even have Xcode. Xcode is the tool

312
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:01,840
and the entire chain of tool sets that gets installed on a Macintosh in order to build

313
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,560
an application for iOS platform. Now, why am I talking about this? The reasoning behind that

314
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,520
is that if you're developing a Flutter application, then Flutter can be deployed

315
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:24,080
on a Windows machine, Macintosh, or collectively called as desktop, web, Android, iOS, five

316
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:32,480
platforms at the moment. If you're trying to release your application and build it for iOS,

317
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,800
for instance, and test on an iPhone or an iPad, you can't do that on a Windows machine,

318
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,520
unfortunately. There's nothing wrong with a Windows machine. It's just Apple's fault for

319
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,520
locking down their build systems and alter tools to Macintosh. They haven't made the

320
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,840
conscious decision or yeah, they haven't made the decision to

321
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,240
bring their tool system and tooling to Windows, unfortunately, or Linux. Swift,

322
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,880
which is the language to write native applications for iOS, can be run, I believe, on Linux.

323
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,680
Windows might be, but its main platform is still Mac.

324
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,920
I know that this is a lot of information also to learn, but if there is anything I want to

325
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,600
close this chapter, the first chapter of this course with is, you can learn Flutter and follow

326
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,720
along with the steps I'm going to provide in this course without having to register any accounts

327
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:48,000
yet. So that's point one. Point two is that you will need a Macintosh if you want to use it for

328
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,520
if you want to comfortably build and release your Flutter app for iOS.

329
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,600
If you want to release your application on Google Play Store, which is point three,

330
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,360
if you want to do that, you will need to register a developer account on Google Play Console,

331
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,320
as I've shown you here. I believe that's all. That's all you need to know. So

332
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,240
some of you may already have all these accounts and don't have to worry about it,

333
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,600
but some may not know all this. If you're coming from a design background, if all you do is work

334
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,000
with Figma, et cetera, this is some of the important information that you'll need to know

335
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,440
about because I don't want you to get frustrated during the process, so I just want you to have

336
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,520
some information so that you can get started at least without too much hassle. All right,

337
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,680
that's it, I think, for this chapter. I can take in my notes that I've explained everything

338
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,320
I wanted to explain. It did take about 35 minutes. It's not unexpected, to be honest.

339
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,280
It's a lot of information, and I kind of want to take my time with it. It's important that you

340
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:09,200
and for me as well to understand all this. So great. I think that's it for this video.

341
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,640
So I'll see you in the next chapter. Hi, everyone, and welcome to the second chapter of our course.

342
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,440
Now, if you haven't watched the introduction to this course, I really suggest that you do that

343
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,120
before continuing with the course because there are so many points that I'll explain in that

344
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,320
introduction that I believe are so important to understand before continuing with the course. So

345
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,400
in this chapter, what we're going to do is we're going to take care of some setup steps that are

346
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,520
required for pretty much the rest of this course and all the other chapters that follow

347
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,200
along after this one, chapter three, four, and et cetera. So we're going to talk about Flutter,

348
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,560
Dart, Dart Pad, how to install Flutter, whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

349
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,560
And we're also going to talk about Xcode, Android Studio, and we're going to talk about a few

350
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,600
very useful extensions to our code editor. So if you're coming from a background where you

351
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,120
haven't worked with any kind of programming language before, I'm going to take this chapter

352
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,320
quite easy. So if you're an advanced programmer already, you may want to skip this and you already

353
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:30,720
have Flutter installed, everything, you can skip this chapter without a problem. So let's start by

354
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,960
talking about what Flutter is. Well, traditionally developers and programmers

355
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,960
or software engineers, however you want to call them, they've been creating and writing code with

356
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,120
their fingers in different languages, and then they're targeting different platforms. It's

357
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,640
very important to understand what a language, programming language is versus a platform.

358
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:06,880
Think of a platform as the end station where a software ends up being run on. So let's say

359
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,720
Windows is a platform, Mac is a platform, Linux is a platform, and iOS that runs on all iPhones

360
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:22,800
is a platform, Android is a platform, et cetera. Now, you would have programming languages that

361
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,200
you as a software developer would use in order to target those platforms, to write software for

362
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,640
those platforms. So you use a programming language in order to write a piece of code

363
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,520
and be able to run that code on that target platform. So the programming language example

364
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:52,160
is JavaScript, Python, Swift, Rust. What else is popular right now? Java, Kotlin, all these.

365
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,120
These are programming languages. So you as a software developer who's trying to learn

366
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,840
Flutter would use then Dart as your programming language, as I will soon explain. So

367
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,080
that has been the tradition that a person sits in front of a computer and says,

368
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,080
okay, I want to write a program for Windows. Then they go and write some code maybe with

369
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,440
Csharp.net, or maybe they will just use some other technology. I don't know what's out there

370
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,640
right now for Windows. Maybe they would use VB.net, and then they would be done and they

371
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,840
would release the software for Windows and be like, okay, I'm done. Now, then someone comes

372
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,920
into the project and says, oh, we need the same software for Macintosh, or we need the same software

373
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:53,200
for some other, for instance, platform. Then you would have to go and write the same software,

374
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,040
exact same code, pretty much, for the other platform. So this process would be very repetitive

375
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,160
in that you would have to write the same software over and over again. So things such as Flutter

376
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,200
came in in order to remedy that. So saying that a software engineer sits at home or sits in the

377
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,000
office, works with a group of other people and a designer maybe, or a few designers, UXer as a

378
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,160
product owner, et cetera. They would write the same code, which will then be run on different

379
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:32,640
platforms. So as a software developer, you wouldn't have to maintain different, very similar pieces of

380
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,960
code that only can be run on one specific platform. So Flutter in its ground basically is a UI

381
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:49,600
framework for writing beautiful applications that run on multiple platforms at the same time.

382
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:58,000
Developed by Google, has been in production for a very long time. It's tried and tested. It's

383
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,960
open source. And if you don't come from a software engineering background, open source basically

384
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:15,760
means that the code that is written for Flutter, basically the code that makes up Flutter, is open

385
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,720
to the public for finding bugs and also for contributing to it or maybe just learning from

386
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,600
it. So if you're, for instance, coming from a background of as a designer, it's kind of like

387
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:34,800
you have your Figma file open to the entire world or your Adobe XD source open to the entire world

388
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,560
for them to watch what you're doing as you're designing and also for them to be able to fix

389
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:49,440
stuff in your design if they see it not working as it should. So that's open source. So Flutter is

390
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,880
open source UI framework developed by Google. What a framework means, I mean, if you're not coming

391
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,720
from a software engineering background, a framework is kind of like a set of tools provided to you

392
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,680
as a software developer. So you can use these tools, take a bit of this one, take a bit of that

393
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:16,160
one in order to produce an output. So Flutter in itself is a software, but it's more precisely

394
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:25,440
referred to as a framework because it's a collection of tools. So if you hear framework,

395
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,280
just know, oh, there's a collection of things I can use to produce some output. Now,

396
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:39,520
that's what Flutter is. But what powers Flutter is a programming language called Dart. And

397
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,560
Dart has been in the making for more than eight years is a language that at the moment being

398
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,440
maintained by Google and also is open source. So anybody can contribute to it, anybody can learn

399
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,120
from it and find exploits or maybe problems with it and it will get patched by the public or by

400
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:06,960
Google themselves. So Dart is the language, the programming language that powers Flutter, you could

401
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:18,800
say. So now you know what Flutter is and now you know what Dart is. And I think in the next step

402
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:27,680
now what we can do is talk about a great piece of web software called Dart Pad. Now,

403
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:37,200
Dart Pad, as I said, is a web software or you could just call it a website that allows you to

404
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:47,520
run or write your Dart code, maybe pure Dart code or code for Flutter and run it directly in your

405
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,760
browser without you even having to install anything. So just open your browser and as you

406
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,200
will see soon we go to Dart Pad and you will see how it looks like. So let me just show you a little

407
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,200
demonstration here. So here I have Dart Pad open and I can actually increase the size so you can

408
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,560
see a little bit better. I may have to rearrange some components here on the screen so you can see

409
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:18,560
the screen better. So I went to dartpad.dartlang.org and you can see here that there is a program

410
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:27,200
written on the left-hand side and I can actually, yeah, let this what is Dart, Dart Pad allows you,

411
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,480
blah, blah, text to be there so you can have context of what I'm talking about. And you can see

412
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,080
that the program is sitting there and you are allowed then to either change the program the

413
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:45,120
way it is or click anywhere here to see documentation down here or press the run button.

414
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,560
So I'm just going to press the run button and you can see that the text hello got printed to the

415
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,640
screen five times plus the number of times it was actually printed. It's also printed to the screen.

416
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,720
So hello one, two, three, four, five. So what you see on this side is the source code if you

417
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,360
remember from open source. So this is the source code written in the programming language called

418
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:18,400
Dart. And this is the output of that program. So Dart Pad allows you to write text here and just

419
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:27,120
execute it and see the results immediately. So that's what Dart is. I mean, sorry, Dart Pad is.

420
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:33,760
And we're going to talk about Dart and Dart Pad more in the course. But right now what we should

421
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:44,160
do is to start by installing Flutter. Because, I mean, you could say, okay, but Flutter is just the

422
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:54,160
UI framework. How about Dart? Well, the way Flutter is packaged by default is that it includes the

423
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,840
Dart programming language and its runtime. So the tool is required to run any Dart code.

424
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,400
It packages all of that in just one big chunk for you. So you don't have to go and install

425
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,600
different components like install Dart separately in Flutter. So let's just then improvise. And I'm

426
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:20,640
going to say in here, let's say install Flutter. Okay? Then you go to this beautiful website called

427
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,200
Flutter.dev. I'm going to increase the size here so you see.

428
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:36,000
So we go there now. And you will see this beautiful website here. And what we're going to do is just

429
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,800
to press on get started. And remember, we pressed on get started. But this website looks like this

430
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,840
right now. Maybe in a few months or maybe in a few years, it will change. So you'll just have

431
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:53,200
to find out a way to get to the installation part. Right now it's called get started. And I

432
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,840
can see it's located as docs.flutter.dev get started install. Then pick your platform here.

433
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,320
I'm on a Macintosh, but if you're on a Windows, just click on Windows and then you get instructions

434
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:12,080
on how to install Flutter. And then, or if you're on Linux, you can also do the same. Just get

435
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:20,560
instructions for your platform. Now I'm on a Mac and I'm going to click on Mac. And then I'm going

436
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,120
to look at this information here. I'm going to increase the size so it's a little bit easier to

437
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,720
read. And it says, okay, download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable

438
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:39,440
release of the Flutter SDK. SDK means software development kit, I believe. So it's just like

439
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:46,800
series of tools for you to use. It's just fancy words. So then we're going to do that. Let's just

440
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,880
get Flutter Mac. I'm going to download it. And it may take some time because it is actually quite

441
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:02,320
a chunky bit of software. As you can see, it's almost 1.2 gigabytes. So depending on your

442
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,880
internet connection, it could take anything between a few seconds to a few minutes.

443
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:14,640
And after you've done that, then you will have to unzip that in some folder.

444
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:23,040
So what that means is just I can see that my Mac is already decompressing this zip file

445
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,120
for me. So I don't have to do that myself. And it's already decompressed in this

446
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,880
place. So I'm just going to click on it and I'm going to show you its content. So it looks like

447
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:42,080
this. Okay. Now that you have this, what you need to do is to ensure that all these files are

448
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:51,360
placed inside a location on your computer, which is protected so that you don't accidentally

449
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:57,040
delete it. And it's also a good, like, you know exactly where it is. So by that, I mean,

450
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,200
don't put it on your desktop and don't put it in like documents or anything. It's not a

451
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:09,840
document. It's a software. What I like to do is usually to have a folder on a Macintosh called

452
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:17,360
Dev. So I will open Terminal here, as you can see. Terminal, if you're not familiar with it,

453
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:25,760
is an application that you can control pretty much the entire system with it. If you're on a Mac or

454
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,480
if you're on Linux or any Unix based system. And if you're on Windows, you can also do a lot with

455
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:39,200
your Terminal. So in Windows, that Terminal is called CMD, I believe, as in command, I believe.

456
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,680
On Linux and Mac, it's called Terminal. I'm using a Terminal here called iTerm.

457
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,520
But if you're on Vanilla Mac OS, then you would go and open Terminal

458
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,400
like this, which is just looking like that.

459
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,920
So I'm going to open iTerm right now, which is my Terminal. You can open the Terminal that

460
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:09,200
you're comfortable with. I'm going to increase the size of this. I like to place

461
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,880
my installations for these pieces of software in my home directory, which is denoted by this

462
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:23,040
little funny character, slash dev. And if I look at the contents of this, I can see

463
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,680
if I look at the contents of this, I can see I have a folder called Toolink. If I say Toolink

464
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,280
and look at the contents of it, I can see Flutter is right there.

465
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:42,160
So for me, Flutter installation, this folder that got downloaded for me in my downloads folder,

466
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:50,080
I would go and copy its contents and place it in this folder. So if I say CD Flutter,

467
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,480
and then you can see that I'm in my user, Dev folder, Toolink, Flutter. So this is where I

468
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,680
choose to put Flutter. Now you can choose to put this downloaded folder anywhere else, as the

469
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:12,080
documentation tells you, in the desired location, for example. So go ahead and do that. Pick a

470
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,600
location. For me, this location works. For you, it may be, if you're on Windows, it would probably be

471
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:26,160
C backslash, I don't know, you could say dev backslash Toolink backslash Flutter. This could

472
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:33,360
be a good location for your Toolink or Flutter. So I'm imagining now that you've done that. You've

473
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,480
gotten a folder, and for me, it's this one, where you've extracted your Flutter installation in.

474
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:47,120
Now you can see that it says, in this third step, you will need to expose Flutter's binary

475
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:55,200
files to your system. And what that basically means is that Flutter as an SDK or a toolkit

476
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:03,600
or a framework, it has a lot of bits and pieces of software in it. And some of these bits are

477
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,200
more important in that sense that they're actually executable in that. Imagine that

478
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,440
on your computer, whether it's a Macintosh, Windows or Linux, you can have different

479
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,440
documents. Some documents can be text. Some documents can be images. Some documents can

480
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,920
be, I don't know what else they can be. Or a Word document, for instance. Okay,

481
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,080
good. I came up with another example. Or they could be programs. A program is something that

482
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,240
you can just double click on and a piece of software gets executed and then it will open.

483
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,040
For instance, an example of the program is a Microsoft Word. Another example of program is

484
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,320
Google Chrome web browser. Another example of program is Safari. So these are programs.

485
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,440
And Flutter comes also with its own built-in programs that do very specific and important

486
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:05,360
things on your computer related to Flutter, of course. Sorry, I have to see my recording studio.

487
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:12,560
Nothing you had to do. It was just for me. So these important programs that are inside

488
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,280
the Flutter installation, which you just downloaded, need to be exposed to your entire system

489
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,080
so that you can work with Flutter with ease. And that means if you're, for instance,

490
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:30,000
from a design background, it will allow you to anywhere in your terminal, just write Figma

491
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,360
and Figma app would open. And that's the same thing with Flutter. In this folder, you see,

492
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:41,600
we're in the Flutter folder where you downloaded your installation and installed it in this folder.

493
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:48,160
There is a folder called bin, which means binary. In here, there are so many things that are important

494
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,920
to the entire system to run. You see Flutter and Dart. These two, I said so many, but yeah,

495
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:01,840
there's pretty much two. So these two binary executables need to be exposed to your system.

496
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,600
And the way to do that on a Macintosh is to change your paths as is documented here.

497
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:18,080
So the way I like to do that is I go and change my, if I do a vim and look at my zshrc,

498
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:27,440
I can see my paths and you can see it here. So you see, I've actually put that export command

499
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:36,080
as it is stated here. I put it here, you see. This may be a bit intimidating, to be honest with you.

500
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Well, all it's doing is that you see this file that I've placed here, I don't know if I can

501
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,080
actually zoom into it. And if you can see, I don't know how that looked in the actual recording,

502
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:57,440
but this is sort of like a set of instructions to my terminal on this Macintosh to tell it

503
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:03,120
where different bits and pieces of binary executables are placed, such as Flutter,

504
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:10,000
Dart, Python, et cetera, et cetera. So when I install a piece of software in this way,

505
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,040
you see, we just downloaded a package and just put it somewhere on our computer.

506
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,680
Macintosh won't know about the stuff that's in it. Of course it won't. So you have to tell it

507
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,320
where those things are. Because otherwise, if you don't do this step, if you don't do the step three,

508
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,840
then every time you want to run Flutter, then you have to specify exactly where that Flutter command

509
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,840
is. So for me, it would be my home folder, dev tooling Flutter bin slash Flutter. But if you do

510
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:43,760
this, then you can anywhere in your terminal, just write Flutter and your Macintosh or Linux or

511
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:52,800
Windows computer will know where to find it. So do that. Put these instructions as specified here

512
00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:00,720
in your path. And after doing that, you may need to reload your path using a command on Windows and

513
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,240
Linux called source and VSHRC for me. Depending on which shell you have, you may have to

514
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,080
put that instruction in somewhere else. On Windows, I believe you will have to modify your

515
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,240
environment variables. I remember this from many, many years ago. Let's see if you have to do that.

516
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:31,280
Update your path, you see. If you wish to run Flutter commands in regular Windows console,

517
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,080
take these steps, blah, blah. From the start search, end and select edit environment variables

518
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,960
for your account. So what you'll just have to do, really, is just to follow these steps. I mean,

519
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,960
I'm going through basically giving you some of the basics of these instructions so you can get

520
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,760
like a head start. But these instructions can also change in the future. So don't rely just on what

521
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:59,040
I'm telling you, please. Just go to the installation website here as you see docs.flutter.dev. Get

522
00:59:59,040 --> 00:59:59,840
started and install.
