0	4320	This massive Flutter course will take you from being an absolute beginner to being able to
4320	9360	release apps on the Google Play Store and the App Store. Vandad is a very experienced
9360	14560	software developer and an excellent teacher. Hello everyone and welcome to this free Flutter
14560	19360	course. My name is Vandad and I'm a Google Developer Expert for Flutter and Dart.
20160	24800	Let's jump right in. Who is this course for? I designed this course mainly for absolute
24800	29440	beginners, so whoever hasn't even done a written a single line of code before.
30160	34080	I actually, when designing this course, I designed it for two specific personas. One was a graphic
34080	38400	designer who was working mainly with Figma. Actually, it doesn't really matter what graphical
38400	44160	tool you're using, Photoshop or Figma or whatever or Sketch. And the other persona was a project
44160	50160	manager who's mainly working with Jira. So I made the assumption that you pretty much don't know
50160	55200	anything about software development from before. And even if you're a software developer, you could
55200	59280	perhaps jump over the things that you might know. But if you haven't done
59280	63280	Flutter development from before, I strongly suggest that you actually follow the chapters
63280	68960	chronologically, which is the way I've designed this course basically. So as I mentioned,
70080	75120	when I designed this course, I wanted everybody to just follow the chapters one at a time and one
75120	80560	after each other chronologically. So I highly recommend that you don't jump over chapters just
80560	85600	because there's so much information provided in each chapter. And I will be referring back to
85600	89920	information that I provided in previous chapters in each chapter. So I think it's very good if you
89920	95120	can just follow the course the way I designed it to be consumed, which is chronologically.
96480	102320	And what you learn in this course is not only the basics, but you'll also go from a complete
102320	108240	beginner to being able to release your applications in Apple's App Store and Google's
108240	113680	Play Store. And we're going to be using a blend of different tools and software. We're going to be
113680	118560	using Visual Studio Code. We're using Firebase for the backend, which I'll teach you all about.
119280	125120	We're using even Figma as a graphic designer to create our icons and screenshots and even our
125520	132480	loading screens. So there's lots to be learned. And I'll take you through those steps. And I don't
132480	137440	make any assumptions about what you may know from before. So I'll explain everything along the way.
137440	143360	So you'll go from absolute beginner to being able to actually release your two applications,
143360	149520	which is the same code base in Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. If you're attending this
149520	155600	course, please do follow me on social media. And I'd really appreciate it. I'm Van.np on Twitter.
155600	160160	And also you can find me by my full name on LinkedIn. That'd be much appreciated.
160160	166720	This course, of course, for free. But for those who want to and are able to support me,
167360	175280	then you can do that by buying me a cup of coffee on buymeacoffee.com. So without further ado,
175280	183520	let's just jump right into it. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first chapter of our Flutter
183520	190880	course. There are so many different topics that I could choose for the first chapter.
192240	198720	And they're all very important. However, after going through the material that I've been
198720	204880	preparing for you for this course, I realized that one of the absolute basic points that we
204880	212960	have to go through is the developer accounts for Apple and Google. Now, if you're not familiar
212960	218480	with the term of developer account, there are basically what a developer account allows you to
218480	228320	do is to release your applications on Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. As I mentioned
228400	236160	in the introduction, you may choose to follow along this course without actually releasing the
236160	245200	application to the App Store and the Play Store. But even if you do decide to not release the
245200	253440	applications on the aforementioned stores, you will still, for the optimal experience of development
253440	262080	for iOS and Android, you will most definitely need a developer account. And the reason behind that
262080	271920	is, I mean, it is quite deep to try to explain the actual reason behind it. But from my perspective,
271920	276480	one of the most important reasons you may want to have a developer account is to create the so-called
277200	286080	app IDs. So every application on iOS and every application on Android has an identifier,
286080	291680	which is usually something called a reverse domain identifier. And it's kind of like,
292800	301600	I still find it strange the way it is, but somewhere, somehow it was decided that every
302240	307040	application needs to have an identifier and every identifier is kind of like associated with a
307040	310800	domain name. And a domain name is kind of like a website. For instance, if you have
312240	320640	yourname.com as your website, then you would say that, okay, I'm going to create an application
320640	327600	for iOS and Android in Flutter, and I'm going to call it foobar. Then it was somehow decided
327600	334240	that your application's identifier would then in that case be, if you reverse it,
334880	344800	then it would literally be your domain in reverse, which would be com.yourname.yourapplicationsname.
346320	353680	I don't really know. I mean, if somebody knows the reason behind it, I would be glad to hear that.
353680	357520	And I'm sure that there's resources out there explaining why that is the case, but it kind of
357520	367680	feels like it's become the norm and we just have to roll with it. So the reason I explained the
367680	375840	app identifier is that when you set up your backend later, when we set up the backend later
375840	382320	together, in that the client that we write in Flutter is going to talk with our backend
382880	388880	store the notes, retrieve the notes, create a user, sign in with a user, et cetera, et cetera,
390880	398960	that backend setup also will require you to have your app identifier. And
401280	407440	even though you don't necessarily need to have a developer account to get an app identifier,
407440	412560	because an app identifier is just something that you decide, okay, here's my app identifier.
412560	417440	I think my website is called this, blah, blah. And even though you actually need a website,
417440	421360	that's the thing, but an app identifier is usually associated with a website. So don't
421360	425840	worry about it. You don't have to have a website in order to follow along with these steps that I'm
425840	432720	going to name here, but it is still good practice to create your developer account in order to
432720	442480	officially register your app identifiers. And another reason that you will need a
442480	452320	developer account for Apple and Google is that you will, for Apple, if you want to be able to
453600	459760	deploy your application onto a telephone and not use a simulator,
460720	467120	then you will need to register a developer account and use some resources that Apple provides you
467120	473760	in forms of certificates and keys and profiles in order to deploy your application to a telephone
473760	481200	or an iPad, for instance. In Android, the world is a little bit different in that you don't have
481200	489360	to do the same process, but in order to then submit your application to Google for review,
490160	494080	later, so that it can be available for everybody who has an Android telephone
495360	500560	or a tablet, you will still need a developer account. So it goes without saying that it is
500560	512480	a very important step that even if you decide not to deploy your application later to App Store and
512480	519200	Play Store, it's still a very fundamental step. So I suggest that you actually go through these
519200	524640	steps that I'm going to provide you in the first chapter. And that's why I actually decided to have
524640	532640	this as chapter one. Sorry, I have to just edit my notes a little bit. If you haven't watched the
532640	536720	introduction to this course, and you're just jumping here, I suggest that you go to the
536720	541200	introduction and watch it. I know it was about 34 minutes. It was quite a long introduction,
541200	547360	but there were so many important points that I feel everybody needs to know before you get
547440	552240	started with the course. So please watch those. If you see me moving my head around, then you know
552240	559520	the reason. And I explain a lot of things that are like the fundamentals of this course and the
559520	565760	reasoning behind all those decisions, which I believe are so important that I still suggest
565760	573200	everybody watched an introduction before they actually start with the course. So we've now
573200	582000	talked about the basics. And if you go to why we need a developer account, I believe I've already
582000	590800	covered this in that the developer account is the utility is an account that you register for Apple
590800	597280	and Google that gives you extra resources as a developer in order to be able to deploy your
597760	601760	test and deploy your applications to the respective app stores.
604560	614720	Now, if we talk about developer accounts, there are two main types of developer accounts. One is
614720	624640	an individual account, and the other one is a company account. And for me, the biggest
624640	631760	difference between these two different accounts is the liability. And by liability, I mean, if you
633840	642400	register an individual account, then you as an individual are liable for that application. And
642400	646720	as users download your application and interact with it, if they have any problems and if, for
646720	655840	instance, there's any judiciary problems, like if someone for some reason believes that you're
655840	660320	storing their data in the wrong way or that you're storing their personal information without
660320	666400	exposing that and telling the users about that, then they can personally hold you liable for,
668560	675040	for instance, breach of information or GDPR infringements or whatever it is. So
676800	684080	just know that you can register yourself as an individual for both Apple's App Store and Google's
684080	690640	Play Store, but you need to also be aware that should you wish to do that, then you're personally
690640	697680	liable for any problems that may be occurring in the future. So that's the personal account
698480	705680	or an individual account. And as a company account, then you kind of like, based on what
705680	716960	type of company you've created, you may or may not be personally liable for any damages that may
716960	721360	be caused to your users and if they bring it up to you. Now, I know this is all sounding a lot
721360	729040	serious. In reality, what we are trying to do is not that big a deal, but we are still trying to
729040	739280	store. I mean, the goal of this course is to go through an application and create an application
739280	747360	that can store users' notes. Notes can be quite personal and you're storing those notes then
748320	754240	on a backend that you have full access to. So you're kind of like storing user-created data.
755040	759600	So it is very important that you actually treat that data correctly. Make sure that nobody
760240	769840	except those who are authorized can access that data. So from a responsibility point of view,
769840	777200	it is actually a little bit different what kind of company account you want to create, if that's
777200	783520	what you want to create now. Because for instance, in Sweden, where I live, you can have a personal
783520	789280	company account in that, sorry, a personal company. So you can register a personal company. It
789280	796880	means that you are personally liable for that company. And you can also create a company that
798400	803760	it has like, it's like an umbrella. Basically, it sits on top and then there are people who are
804400	808480	directors of the company and blah, blah. So you're not personally liable.
809440	816240	And that is the same structure that you can find in many other countries. I believe US, Germany,
816240	825040	Sweden, England, many other countries, you can set up companies that are either sole proprietorship
825040	828960	or something called, English is not my first language, but it's something like that. Or you
828960	833120	can create like a limited company that you have limited liability and you're not personally liable.
833120	838560	So these are the different types of developer accounts that you can set up.
839360	846480	So we can, I mean, that point, I think we all understand now that you can create
846480	855600	individual or a company account. Now, I think, I mean, I personally registered already an account
856240	862240	as an iOS developer and an Android app developer. So,
864400	871280	and since I registered a company account, I can't go through setting up the exact same company again,
871920	879520	but at least I can show you some of the steps involved in creating those accounts.
880480	888960	So what we could do is to, now you can't see the screen right now, but I will bring it up here
890560	899040	so that you can also see. Now I'm going to bring my studio here and I'm going to make this screen
899040	906160	a little bit bigger so that you can see my screen better. So let me also make this a little bit
906480	912960	smaller on top so that you can see the content a little bit better.
914800	920560	So you can see here that there are two options available to you. Either you enroll as an individual
920560	926560	or you enroll as an organization. And it is strongly recommended actually.
929440	933200	So you need to make sure that you have two-factor authentication turned on.
933200	939920	And so that's not a problem. All this means basically as an individual, it means that just
940480	946880	you will need an account. You will need to set up an account. However, if you want to set up as an
946880	952160	organization, like if you have a limited company and you want to create an Apple developer account
952160	959040	that is linked to that organization, it's a little bit different because you will need to set up
959040	963520	something called a duns or duns or I don't know how you want to pronounce it D-U-N-S.
964640	972400	Which is kind of like, it's a new thing for me at least, but it is an identifier for your company
972400	980880	that you either have been assigned to already. I think there is a company called DMB.
980880	988720	So if you go to, let me see if I can bring the notes for that.
990720	1002320	Let's see. Learn more. If you go to learn more here. Here, DMB is called by Don and Bradstreet.
1002320	1011440	So there then we have the ability to register a D-U-N-S number.
1013360	1018800	For me, I was one of the lucky people to have already been assigned a D-U-N-S number for my
1018800	1026720	company by DMB because you either have, let's see if they write it here.
1027680	1031440	You see it says DMB may have already assigned your organization a free
1031440	1036800	D-U-N-S number. Before enrolling, look up your organization to see if you have a D-U-N-S number.
1036800	1044880	So you can just click on the link and we can go here and you can then select your region. For me,
1044880	1051040	it would be Sweden. Then I would write my company name, some address information, contact information,
1051040	1057440	etc. Then you can check whether there is a D-U-N-S number assigned to your company.
1057440	1061200	So I suggest that you actually do this by going to this website.
1066000	1070880	So that's for a D-U-N-S number if you already have one, but if you don't have one,
1070880	1078320	then you will have to create and request a D-U-N-S number from DMB. I would show you the website for
1078320	1085360	DMB and D-U-N-S number right now, but my browser is set up so that my locale is already provided to
1085360	1089280	the browser, which is Swedish. Then if I go to the DMB website, you're going to see everything in
1089280	1096560	Swedish. That doesn't make any sense just to read the information in Swedish. I believe you can go
1096560	1107040	to DMB's website. So if I search for a DMB, D-U-N-S or D-U-N-S are here. So this is a Swedish
1108080	1113600	localized website for DMB. Let's see if it can change the language.
1117520	1121760	Actually, I can see here that they're very, they're actually in Sweden.
1121760	1128960	And I wonder if we can, here, change country. Let's just say
1132880	1133600	international.
1136400	1141200	So if we go here, let's see if we can,
1143920	1150240	if there's any way to actually request a D-U-N-S number, like if you say D-U-N-S.
1152560	1160160	And I can't see anything related to that, to be honest with you. So if we go back
1163680	1170720	here, I can see, I can request the D-U-N-S and here the locale is S-V-S-E. And here,
1170720	1176400	the locale was E-N-G-B. So what happens if we just go back to this URL that we were on before,
1176880	1184720	and then I just change the locale? Does that work? Well, unfortunately. But, I mean, here,
1184720	1193520	D-U-N-S number, get a D-U-N-S number. Okay, that's good. And then, and you can here say,
1193520	1203040	I'm an Apple developer, press continue. Oh, it sends you back here. That was really bad.
1203360	1214240	So it says, look up your organization in Apple's website. And when you try to get a D-U-N-S number,
1215040	1226000	it tells you to go to Apple's website. If we say that, then okay, legal business name, etc., etc.
1226720	1234160	Then okay, legal business name, etc., etc. Okay, so you will need to go through this process,
1234160	1239600	which doesn't seem to be completely easy to get a D-U-N-S number. You see, request the D-U-N-S
1239600	1248240	number. So you probably just want to go to dmb.com, it's like d-u-n-s-number.html. And I can't
1248240	1252800	explain this complete process, to be honest with you, because first of all, it will be a waste of
1252800	1260160	time for both of us. Because these are so many moving parts and a third party company that I
1260160	1266080	have no control over. So if I even try to explain their process, it may change tomorrow. So there's,
1266080	1271360	it's not a good investment of our time. But everybody else has figured it out. And I'm
1271360	1274960	pretty sure that if you just go and say, request the D-U-N-S number, you can just
1275520	1281920	follow the process and then get your D-U-N-S number. But begin by going through,
1283120	1290560	look up your organization. So you may already have been assigned a free D-U-N-S number. So
1291600	1297040	do that first, please. But if you have to request the D-U-N-S number, I believe there is a little
1297040	1304000	bit of a cost to it. And that is about $70. If I'm 70 to $80 at the time of recording this video.
1304720	1315040	So count with almost about $100. And hopefully not more, hopefully actually a lot less, but around
1316720	1326160	$70 at least. Does that make sense? I said so many numbers, $70 at least. So try to get your
1326160	1331920	D-U-N-S number. At least that that's what Apple says you will need. Now, of course, if you want
1331920	1339840	to register as a company, I can't stress this enough. You will need a website. I remember vividly
1339840	1348000	when I registered a developer account at Apple and they rejected my request saying that, well,
1348640	1355680	your website doesn't have any content. And they were right because I just created an empty website,
1355680	1360800	like a domain. I know I didn't actually create an empty website. I registered a domain.
1362240	1368480	And there was no website. So when you typed my website's name, it would just not show you anything.
1371440	1374960	And they came back and said, no, your application is rejected because you don't have a website.
1374960	1381440	What kind of company are you? So then I had to actually get like a hosting service and I have
1381440	1388880	some content in there, have like a support. So if you are registering as a website, sorry,
1388880	1394400	as a company and as an organization, you will need a hosting service. You will need a domain
1394400	1400480	provider. You will need to ensure that you have a website because they're not the same thing. If
1400480	1406400	you have a host and you have a domain provider, it still doesn't mean that you have content
1407520	1414480	on your web page. But what I realized is that if you register your domain and have a hosting
1414480	1419680	service, make sure that you have a website. Just have some content in there and say, hello,
1419680	1426240	we are this business, that business. We work with this and this. If you have any questions,
1426240	1430480	contact this email. And here's our phone number. Here's their address, et cetera. So
1430480	1437520	you need to ensure that if you have an organization, it is actually an organization. It's not just like,
1437520	1444080	hi, my name is Fubar. I'm sitting at home. Contact me if you have any questions. Not like that.
1444640	1450400	So and of course, after you made your decision, you start the enrollment process. So
1452400	1458560	now learn more, continue enrollment on the web you can do. And then you come here and you will
1458560	1463920	basically need to provide your information and continue with the process. Now we're not going
1463920	1470400	to go through this, but the important thing I have to mention here is that as you go through
1470400	1479040	the enrollment process, as an Apple developer, unfortunately, there is a cost last time, which
1479040	1484320	is about a few months ago when I registered, or I had to renew my registration. You have to renew
1484320	1493840	your registration for Apple's developer account. You have to renew it every year. And as I've
1493840	1502000	mentioned here, the process is not free, unfortunately. It costs, or last time I
1502000	1507520	registered or renewed my registration, it costs $99. And I believe it's been $99 for a very long
1507520	1512720	time. So if you're in Sweden, it costs about a thousand crowns. If you're in England, it probably
1512720	1519760	costs about 80 pounds or something. And in the US it's about, yeah, just count with almost $100. So
1520320	1524400	I used to be able to provide this like you have to have some sort of a credit card or debit card
1524400	1530400	to be able to pay for it. So after you've done that, after you register your account as an
1530400	1535760	organization, you will have direct access then, or an immediate access to your developer account.
1535760	1542720	And you can start developing applications, et cetera, et cetera. So if you're following along
1543520	1550240	with this course and you want to deploy your application to the App Store and Play Store,
1550240	1558640	please do this first. Get your developer account either as an organization or as an individual.
1559600	1564160	Get that process out of the way because a developer account, especially if you're an
1564160	1570480	organization, as I mentioned here, is not a super fast process. I mean, when you get the account,
1570480	1576960	then it's simple. It's fast and you're in there immediately. But the process itself is a long
1576960	1582640	process. So I remember for me, it took about two weeks because I got one rejection. It took about
1582640	1591680	one week for them to review the documents again. So it's not a fast process, unfortunately. It's
1591680	1602960	like very, yeah, it's just a long, long, boring process. So get that out of the way, if you can,
1602960	1619600	please. So that's for the long and not free part for iOS. And also, one more thing that I need to
1619600	1626800	mention is that if you're registering and you want to sell applications, which is not the purpose of
1626800	1631520	this course, but if you want to sell applications, then you will have to provide some banking
1632080	1637440	and tax information. So they need to ensure that the stuff that you're selling in different
1637440	1642720	countries, the money that is then being sent to your bank account, will be accounted for when
1642720	1650240	you're paying your taxes. So, and I believe that if you're trying to sell apps on the app store,
1650240	1658320	then you will have to fill in some forms with the US tax offices. I don't even remember IRS, I think
1659840	1665280	internal revenue services or something like the IRS. I believe that you have to fill some forms,
1665280	1669680	like send the forms to them, then they will come back with some sort of identifier to you.
1669680	1674960	And then you will need to use that identifier on Apple's website in order to basically say
1674960	1679840	that, yeah, yeah, I know, I'm selling stuff in the US, I'm selling stuff in Japan, I'm selling
1679840	1686960	stuff in Sweden, Norway, but I'm going to pay taxes for them here in my country. And that's
1686960	1695360	what the form says here. Here's my name, here's my company. I'm an organization or I'm an individual,
1695360	1703200	so I have no company. My personal identification number in my country is this, is my address,
1703200	1708240	my phone number, et cetera. And then you send it to them, to IRS, and then they come back and say,
1708240	1715920	okay, now we know who you are. And here is your identifier number, like a business identifier
1715920	1720320	number, BIN or something they call it, I think. I don't remember exactly, but I believe depending
1720320	1723920	on whether you're a business or an individual, then the number is a little bit different.
1724880	1728800	So if you're a business, I think it's BIN. And if you're an individual is in, I don't know.
1729600	1734560	So I don't know what that dialogue was. Some Bluetooth devices wants to connect to my computer.
1734560	1743040	I don't know what it is. So that's that part. It can be long and it's not free. Okay.
1745920	1753840	That was a lot of information. That's for iOS. Now, what we can do now is to talk
1753840	1759680	a little bit about Android as well. And the good thing about the Android process,
1759680	1766000	like setting up your account for, as a Google developer, is that it's a lot more straightforward
1766000	1772320	as you would expect from Google. And given that they're even like sending updates to
1772320	1777360	an Android app to the Google developer console is a lot more straightforward than it is for iOS.
1777360	1782640	I don't want to scare you, but it is a fact. And you will know that later when we actually
1782640	1788800	get to the end of this course where we release the apps for iOS and Android, that it is a little
1788800	1798080	bit more straightforward for Google Play Store. But you still need to sign up for a developer
1798080	1808080	account. So I'm going to take in my notes that I've talked about that. So what we also need to know
1808080	1814000	is that there is a URL that we can go to. I'm going to copy that and paste it over here. So
1814000	1822400	you see which one I'm talking about. Over here. Then you can see that you can set up a developer
1822400	1826080	account. And once you've logged in, so I'm assuming that you're logged in, then you go to
1826080	1834560	play.google.com slash console slash user or you zero sign up where URL, it may change. So let's
1834560	1840480	just, what you can do is just a Google, Google Play Console developer account or a Google
1840480	1846000	developer account. Then you will end up in a URL that looks kind of like this. So don't count
1846000	1850400	with this URL that I mentioned here because it may change. That's what I'm saying. And
1851760	1855920	you can, as it is for iOS development, you can either set it up personally as an individual or
1855920	1861040	you can set up as an organization. Now I happen to have set it up for myself as an organization
1861040	1866080	because I do have a company here in Sweden. So it is a lot easier for me to tie all my business
1866080	1871200	relations with Apple and Google into one entity, which is my developer account for,
1873600	1880880	sorry, which is my company. So it wouldn't make so much sense for me to explain this either to go
1880880	1885120	through all the details, but if you want to set it up for yourself as an individual, just press on
1885120	1888480	get started. Or if you want to set up as an organization, just press get started there.
1888480	1893920	As you can see, you can provide information about your organization. And you can see here as well,
1894480	1899920	as soon as you say I'm an organization, then they say, okay, what's the website? So you can see if
1899920	1903520	you say, I don't have a website, we recommend adding a website that represents your organization.
1903520	1908320	Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, if you're a company, where's your website? Every company
1908320	1913520	should have a website unless you're like a pizza restaurant or something. Even a pizza restaurant
1913520	1917280	probably needs a website, but we have a pizza restaurant here in our town that doesn't have
1917280	1925280	a website. So they're on Facebook. And you probably don't want to say that your company's
1925280	1933680	website is on Facebook. So yeah, where were we? Here. And if you say you're an individual,
1933680	1939840	then you come here and they ask for some other stuff, but still interesting because
1940720	1947120	it says enter the URL of your website or social media profile. So here you kind of have to need
1948080	1952400	to enter that as well. So maybe you can get away with a Facebook URL. I laughed about it, but
1953280	1957120	maybe you can get away with it. I don't know. But I don't recommend that, to be honest with you,
1957120	1963040	because as you will see later in the course, when we actually submit our apps to App Store and Play
1963040	1971120	Store, there are a few key data points that you have to provide to both stores. One is a privacy
1971200	1983840	policy URL, and the other one is a support URL. And there are also two other emails you have to
1983840	1994160	provide. The first one is the support email and the other one is a contact email. And if you're
1994160	1998560	setting up a business account, then I really suggest that you actually set up a website,
1998560	2003040	because if you set up a website and you have a domain, you have an email provider,
2003040	2012160	then your email will kind of be like foobar at mybusiness.com. It's a lot more professional
2012160	2019280	to set up an email that is connected to your email or to your domain than it is to say
2020000	2027920	mrjohnson at gmail.com. I wouldn't trust a business that has a gmail.com account.
2029280	2032960	I kind of want to know that, yeah, here's a serious business, that they have their own website,
2032960	2041040	and blah, blah, blah. But on the contrary, setting up a website, setting up some emails
2041040	2046960	doesn't necessarily mean you're serious either. But it makes it more dedicated, if you know what
2046960	2057680	I mean. So yeah, that's the process for setting up an account also as an Android developer.
2059520	2066640	I think that's about it. That's all I wanted to mention in this first chapter of our course.
2068320	2074000	I highly recommend that you get your developer accounts for Apple and for
2077120	2083520	Google. What you'll also need to know is that, I mean, I've talked a lot about now,
2084000	2093920	Apple account and a Google developer account, but if you're developing your application
2096160	2100240	on a Windows machine, for instance, if you're trying to learn how to develop Flutter
2100240	2104560	applications and you don't care about releasing your application at all, you don't have to do
2104560	2112400	any of this. Just follow along with the course as usual, no problem. But if you want to actually
2112400	2117840	release your application for iOS, then you most definitely need to also have a Mac because you
2117840	2123840	can't build your application otherwise. There are some tricks you can do. You can build your
2123840	2129040	Flutter application and later on, like a friend's Macintosh if they have one, or you can send it to
2129040	2133600	a service that's in the cloud and they build the app for you and then they will send it back to
2133600	2139280	you and then you can submit it. Or maybe they even have to submit it. It's a bit hairy, to be
2139280	2145840	honest with you, but it's a complicated topic. It is a little bit difficult to explain.
2148000	2153120	For instance, if you're on a Windows machine, you can't even have Xcode. Xcode is the tool
2153680	2161840	and the entire chain of tool sets that gets installed on a Macintosh in order to build
2162880	2168560	an application for iOS platform. Now, why am I talking about this? The reasoning behind that
2168560	2175520	is that if you're developing a Flutter application, then Flutter can be deployed
2175520	2184080	on a Windows machine, Macintosh, or collectively called as desktop, web, Android, iOS, five
2184080	2192480	platforms at the moment. If you're trying to release your application and build it for iOS,
2192480	2198800	for instance, and test on an iPhone or an iPad, you can't do that on a Windows machine,
2198800	2205520	unfortunately. There's nothing wrong with a Windows machine. It's just Apple's fault for
2205520	2211520	locking down their build systems and alter tools to Macintosh. They haven't made the
2212720	2217840	conscious decision or yeah, they haven't made the decision to
2218640	2226240	bring their tool system and tooling to Windows, unfortunately, or Linux. Swift,
2226240	2232880	which is the language to write native applications for iOS, can be run, I believe, on Linux.
2233920	2239680	Windows might be, but its main platform is still Mac.
2240640	2245920	I know that this is a lot of information also to learn, but if there is anything I want to
2246720	2253600	close this chapter, the first chapter of this course with is, you can learn Flutter and follow
2253600	2258720	along with the steps I'm going to provide in this course without having to register any accounts
2258720	2268000	yet. So that's point one. Point two is that you will need a Macintosh if you want to use it for
2268640	2275520	if you want to comfortably build and release your Flutter app for iOS.
2278000	2283600	If you want to release your application on Google Play Store, which is point three,
2283600	2289360	if you want to do that, you will need to register a developer account on Google Play Console,
2289920	2296320	as I've shown you here. I believe that's all. That's all you need to know. So
2297280	2300240	some of you may already have all these accounts and don't have to worry about it,
2301280	2307600	but some may not know all this. If you're coming from a design background, if all you do is work
2307600	2312000	with Figma, et cetera, this is some of the important information that you'll need to know
2312000	2317440	about because I don't want you to get frustrated during the process, so I just want you to have
2317440	2323520	some information so that you can get started at least without too much hassle. All right,
2323520	2329680	that's it, I think, for this chapter. I can take in my notes that I've explained everything
2329680	2336320	I wanted to explain. It did take about 35 minutes. It's not unexpected, to be honest.
2336320	2341280	It's a lot of information, and I kind of want to take my time with it. It's important that you
2341840	2349200	and for me as well to understand all this. So great. I think that's it for this video.
2349920	2356640	So I'll see you in the next chapter. Hi, everyone, and welcome to the second chapter of our course.
2356640	2361440	Now, if you haven't watched the introduction to this course, I really suggest that you do that
2361440	2365120	before continuing with the course because there are so many points that I'll explain in that
2365760	2370320	introduction that I believe are so important to understand before continuing with the course. So
2372000	2376400	in this chapter, what we're going to do is we're going to take care of some setup steps that are
2376400	2383520	required for pretty much the rest of this course and all the other chapters that follow
2383520	2389200	along after this one, chapter three, four, and et cetera. So we're going to talk about Flutter,
2389200	2396560	Dart, Dart Pad, how to install Flutter, whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
2396560	2404560	And we're also going to talk about Xcode, Android Studio, and we're going to talk about a few
2404560	2411600	very useful extensions to our code editor. So if you're coming from a background where you
2411600	2417120	haven't worked with any kind of programming language before, I'm going to take this chapter
2417120	2422320	quite easy. So if you're an advanced programmer already, you may want to skip this and you already
2422320	2430720	have Flutter installed, everything, you can skip this chapter without a problem. So let's start by
2430720	2436960	talking about what Flutter is. Well, traditionally developers and programmers
2436960	2442960	or software engineers, however you want to call them, they've been creating and writing code with
2442960	2449120	their fingers in different languages, and then they're targeting different platforms. It's
2449120	2454640	very important to understand what a language, programming language is versus a platform.
2455600	2466880	Think of a platform as the end station where a software ends up being run on. So let's say
2466880	2474720	Windows is a platform, Mac is a platform, Linux is a platform, and iOS that runs on all iPhones
2474720	2482800	is a platform, Android is a platform, et cetera. Now, you would have programming languages that
2483760	2489200	you as a software developer would use in order to target those platforms, to write software for
2489200	2494640	those platforms. So you use a programming language in order to write a piece of code
2494640	2501520	and be able to run that code on that target platform. So the programming language example
2501520	2512160	is JavaScript, Python, Swift, Rust. What else is popular right now? Java, Kotlin, all these.
2512800	2519120	These are programming languages. So you as a software developer who's trying to learn
2519120	2525840	Flutter would use then Dart as your programming language, as I will soon explain. So
2528880	2532080	that has been the tradition that a person sits in front of a computer and says,
2532080	2536080	okay, I want to write a program for Windows. Then they go and write some code maybe with
2536080	2543440	Csharp.net, or maybe they will just use some other technology. I don't know what's out there
2543440	2550640	right now for Windows. Maybe they would use VB.net, and then they would be done and they
2550640	2555840	would release the software for Windows and be like, okay, I'm done. Now, then someone comes
2555840	2561920	into the project and says, oh, we need the same software for Macintosh, or we need the same software
2561920	2573200	for some other, for instance, platform. Then you would have to go and write the same software,
2574480	2581040	exact same code, pretty much, for the other platform. So this process would be very repetitive
2581040	2586160	in that you would have to write the same software over and over again. So things such as Flutter
2586160	2591200	came in in order to remedy that. So saying that a software engineer sits at home or sits in the
2591200	2596000	office, works with a group of other people and a designer maybe, or a few designers, UXer as a
2596000	2604160	product owner, et cetera. They would write the same code, which will then be run on different
2604160	2612640	platforms. So as a software developer, you wouldn't have to maintain different, very similar pieces of
2612640	2620960	code that only can be run on one specific platform. So Flutter in its ground basically is a UI
2620960	2629600	framework for writing beautiful applications that run on multiple platforms at the same time.
2630320	2638000	Developed by Google, has been in production for a very long time. It's tried and tested. It's
2638000	2644960	open source. And if you don't come from a software engineering background, open source basically
2644960	2655760	means that the code that is written for Flutter, basically the code that makes up Flutter, is open
2655760	2662720	to the public for finding bugs and also for contributing to it or maybe just learning from
2662720	2667600	it. So if you're, for instance, coming from a background of as a designer, it's kind of like
2667600	2674800	you have your Figma file open to the entire world or your Adobe XD source open to the entire world
2675120	2680560	for them to watch what you're doing as you're designing and also for them to be able to fix
2680560	2689440	stuff in your design if they see it not working as it should. So that's open source. So Flutter is
2689440	2696880	open source UI framework developed by Google. What a framework means, I mean, if you're not coming
2696880	2702720	from a software engineering background, a framework is kind of like a set of tools provided to you
2702720	2707680	as a software developer. So you can use these tools, take a bit of this one, take a bit of that
2707680	2716160	one in order to produce an output. So Flutter in itself is a software, but it's more precisely
2716800	2725440	referred to as a framework because it's a collection of tools. So if you hear framework,
2725440	2729280	just know, oh, there's a collection of things I can use to produce some output. Now,
2730240	2739520	that's what Flutter is. But what powers Flutter is a programming language called Dart. And
2740400	2746560	Dart has been in the making for more than eight years is a language that at the moment being
2746560	2753440	maintained by Google and also is open source. So anybody can contribute to it, anybody can learn
2753440	2759120	from it and find exploits or maybe problems with it and it will get patched by the public or by
2759120	2766960	Google themselves. So Dart is the language, the programming language that powers Flutter, you could
2766960	2778800	say. So now you know what Flutter is and now you know what Dart is. And I think in the next step
2778800	2787680	now what we can do is talk about a great piece of web software called Dart Pad. Now,
2789120	2797200	Dart Pad, as I said, is a web software or you could just call it a website that allows you to
2797200	2807520	run or write your Dart code, maybe pure Dart code or code for Flutter and run it directly in your
2807520	2813760	browser without you even having to install anything. So just open your browser and as you
2813760	2819200	will see soon we go to Dart Pad and you will see how it looks like. So let me just show you a little
2819200	2825200	demonstration here. So here I have Dart Pad open and I can actually increase the size so you can
2825200	2830560	see a little bit better. I may have to rearrange some components here on the screen so you can see
2830560	2838560	the screen better. So I went to dartpad.dartlang.org and you can see here that there is a program
2838560	2847200	written on the left-hand side and I can actually, yeah, let this what is Dart, Dart Pad allows you,
2847200	2852480	blah, blah, text to be there so you can have context of what I'm talking about. And you can see
2852480	2858080	that the program is sitting there and you are allowed then to either change the program the
2858080	2865120	way it is or click anywhere here to see documentation down here or press the run button.
2865120	2870560	So I'm just going to press the run button and you can see that the text hello got printed to the
2870560	2876640	screen five times plus the number of times it was actually printed. It's also printed to the screen.
2876640	2884720	So hello one, two, three, four, five. So what you see on this side is the source code if you
2884720	2889360	remember from open source. So this is the source code written in the programming language called
2889360	2898400	Dart. And this is the output of that program. So Dart Pad allows you to write text here and just
2898400	2907120	execute it and see the results immediately. So that's what Dart is. I mean, sorry, Dart Pad is.
2907120	2913760	And we're going to talk about Dart and Dart Pad more in the course. But right now what we should
2913760	2924160	do is to start by installing Flutter. Because, I mean, you could say, okay, but Flutter is just the
2926640	2934160	UI framework. How about Dart? Well, the way Flutter is packaged by default is that it includes the
2934160	2939840	Dart programming language and its runtime. So the tool is required to run any Dart code.
2940800	2946400	It packages all of that in just one big chunk for you. So you don't have to go and install
2946400	2951600	different components like install Dart separately in Flutter. So let's just then improvise. And I'm
2951600	2960640	going to say in here, let's say install Flutter. Okay? Then you go to this beautiful website called
2960720	2965200	Flutter.dev. I'm going to increase the size here so you see.
2967600	2976000	So we go there now. And you will see this beautiful website here. And what we're going to do is just
2976000	2982800	to press on get started. And remember, we pressed on get started. But this website looks like this
2982800	2987840	right now. Maybe in a few months or maybe in a few years, it will change. So you'll just have
2987840	2993200	to find out a way to get to the installation part. Right now it's called get started. And I
2993200	2999840	can see it's located as docs.flutter.dev get started install. Then pick your platform here.
2999840	3004320	I'm on a Macintosh, but if you're on a Windows, just click on Windows and then you get instructions
3004320	3012080	on how to install Flutter. And then, or if you're on Linux, you can also do the same. Just get
3012080	3020560	instructions for your platform. Now I'm on a Mac and I'm going to click on Mac. And then I'm going
3020560	3025120	to look at this information here. I'm going to increase the size so it's a little bit easier to
3025120	3030720	read. And it says, okay, download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable
3030720	3039440	release of the Flutter SDK. SDK means software development kit, I believe. So it's just like
3040080	3046800	series of tools for you to use. It's just fancy words. So then we're going to do that. Let's just
3046800	3054880	get Flutter Mac. I'm going to download it. And it may take some time because it is actually quite
3054880	3062320	a chunky bit of software. As you can see, it's almost 1.2 gigabytes. So depending on your
3062320	3066880	internet connection, it could take anything between a few seconds to a few minutes.
3067520	3074640	And after you've done that, then you will have to unzip that in some folder.
3076080	3083040	So what that means is just I can see that my Mac is already decompressing this zip file
3083040	3087120	for me. So I don't have to do that myself. And it's already decompressed in this
3087120	3092880	place. So I'm just going to click on it and I'm going to show you its content. So it looks like
3092880	3102080	this. Okay. Now that you have this, what you need to do is to ensure that all these files are
3102080	3111360	placed inside a location on your computer, which is protected so that you don't accidentally
3111360	3117040	delete it. And it's also a good, like, you know exactly where it is. So by that, I mean,
3117040	3121200	don't put it on your desktop and don't put it in like documents or anything. It's not a
3121200	3129840	document. It's a software. What I like to do is usually to have a folder on a Macintosh called
3129840	3137360	Dev. So I will open Terminal here, as you can see. Terminal, if you're not familiar with it,
3137360	3145760	is an application that you can control pretty much the entire system with it. If you're on a Mac or
3145760	3150480	if you're on Linux or any Unix based system. And if you're on Windows, you can also do a lot with
3150480	3159200	your Terminal. So in Windows, that Terminal is called CMD, I believe, as in command, I believe.
3160400	3167680	On Linux and Mac, it's called Terminal. I'm using a Terminal here called iTerm.
3169680	3173520	But if you're on Vanilla Mac OS, then you would go and open Terminal
3174080	3176400	like this, which is just looking like that.
3176400	3181920	So I'm going to open iTerm right now, which is my Terminal. You can open the Terminal that
3181920	3189200	you're comfortable with. I'm going to increase the size of this. I like to place
3190640	3194880	my installations for these pieces of software in my home directory, which is denoted by this
3194880	3203040	little funny character, slash dev. And if I look at the contents of this, I can see
3203520	3209680	if I look at the contents of this, I can see I have a folder called Toolink. If I say Toolink
3210560	3213280	and look at the contents of it, I can see Flutter is right there.
3214560	3222160	So for me, Flutter installation, this folder that got downloaded for me in my downloads folder,
3223040	3230080	I would go and copy its contents and place it in this folder. So if I say CD Flutter,
3231040	3238480	and then you can see that I'm in my user, Dev folder, Toolink, Flutter. So this is where I
3238480	3243680	choose to put Flutter. Now you can choose to put this downloaded folder anywhere else, as the
3243680	3252080	documentation tells you, in the desired location, for example. So go ahead and do that. Pick a
3252080	3257600	location. For me, this location works. For you, it may be, if you're on Windows, it would probably be
3257840	3266160	C backslash, I don't know, you could say dev backslash Toolink backslash Flutter. This could
3266160	3273360	be a good location for your Toolink or Flutter. So I'm imagining now that you've done that. You've
3273360	3278480	gotten a folder, and for me, it's this one, where you've extracted your Flutter installation in.
3279120	3287120	Now you can see that it says, in this third step, you will need to expose Flutter's binary
3287120	3295200	files to your system. And what that basically means is that Flutter as an SDK or a toolkit
3295200	3303600	or a framework, it has a lot of bits and pieces of software in it. And some of these bits are
3303600	3309200	more important in that sense that they're actually executable in that. Imagine that
3310400	3315440	on your computer, whether it's a Macintosh, Windows or Linux, you can have different
3315440	3319440	documents. Some documents can be text. Some documents can be images. Some documents can
3320320	3325920	be, I don't know what else they can be. Or a Word document, for instance. Okay,
3325920	3332080	good. I came up with another example. Or they could be programs. A program is something that
3332080	3336240	you can just double click on and a piece of software gets executed and then it will open.
3336240	3343040	For instance, an example of the program is a Microsoft Word. Another example of program is
3343040	3350320	Google Chrome web browser. Another example of program is Safari. So these are programs.
3350320	3355440	And Flutter comes also with its own built-in programs that do very specific and important
3355440	3365360	things on your computer related to Flutter, of course. Sorry, I have to see my recording studio.
3365360	3372560	Nothing you had to do. It was just for me. So these important programs that are inside
3372560	3377280	the Flutter installation, which you just downloaded, need to be exposed to your entire system
3377920	3384080	so that you can work with Flutter with ease. And that means if you're, for instance,
3384080	3390000	from a design background, it will allow you to anywhere in your terminal, just write Figma
3390000	3395360	and Figma app would open. And that's the same thing with Flutter. In this folder, you see,
3395360	3401600	we're in the Flutter folder where you downloaded your installation and installed it in this folder.
3401600	3408160	There is a folder called bin, which means binary. In here, there are so many things that are important
3408160	3413920	to the entire system to run. You see Flutter and Dart. These two, I said so many, but yeah,
3413920	3421840	there's pretty much two. So these two binary executables need to be exposed to your system.
3422400	3427600	And the way to do that on a Macintosh is to change your paths as is documented here.
3428560	3438080	So the way I like to do that is I go and change my, if I do a vim and look at my zshrc,
3439200	3447440	I can see my paths and you can see it here. So you see, I've actually put that export command
3447440	3456080	as it is stated here. I put it here, you see. This may be a bit intimidating, to be honest with you.
3457600	3463600	Well, all it's doing is that you see this file that I've placed here, I don't know if I can
3463600	3468080	actually zoom into it. And if you can see, I don't know how that looked in the actual recording,
3468720	3477440	but this is sort of like a set of instructions to my terminal on this Macintosh to tell it
3477440	3483120	where different bits and pieces of binary executables are placed, such as Flutter,
3483840	3490000	Dart, Python, et cetera, et cetera. So when I install a piece of software in this way,
3490000	3493040	you see, we just downloaded a package and just put it somewhere on our computer.
3493920	3499680	Macintosh won't know about the stuff that's in it. Of course it won't. So you have to tell it
3499680	3506320	where those things are. Because otherwise, if you don't do this step, if you don't do the step three,
3506320	3511840	then every time you want to run Flutter, then you have to specify exactly where that Flutter command
3511840	3517840	is. So for me, it would be my home folder, dev tooling Flutter bin slash Flutter. But if you do
3517840	3523760	this, then you can anywhere in your terminal, just write Flutter and your Macintosh or Linux or
3524560	3532800	Windows computer will know where to find it. So do that. Put these instructions as specified here
3532800	3540720	in your path. And after doing that, you may need to reload your path using a command on Windows and
3540720	3548240	Linux called source and VSHRC for me. Depending on which shell you have, you may have to
3550000	3556080	put that instruction in somewhere else. On Windows, I believe you will have to modify your
3557760	3564240	environment variables. I remember this from many, many years ago. Let's see if you have to do that.
3564400	3571280	Update your path, you see. If you wish to run Flutter commands in regular Windows console,
3571280	3576080	take these steps, blah, blah. From the start search, end and select edit environment variables
3576080	3580960	for your account. So what you'll just have to do, really, is just to follow these steps. I mean,
3580960	3586960	I'm going through basically giving you some of the basics of these instructions so you can get
3586960	3591760	like a head start. But these instructions can also change in the future. So don't rely just on what
3591760	3599040	I'm telling you, please. Just go to the installation website here as you see docs.flutter.dev. Get
3599040	3599840	started and install.
